So this is a natural thing to look at. $$ \\matrix { A & \\overset { \\textstyle f } \\rightarrow & B \\\\ \\llap f \\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\rlap { k _ 1 } \\\\ B & \\underset { \\textstyle k _ 0 } \\rightarrow & C } $$ The cokernel pair is a set $ C $ defined as a quotient of the disjoint union $ B \\uplus B $ ; if $ y $ is an element of $ B $ , then I'll write $ y _ 0 $ and $ y _ 1 $ for elements of $ B \\uplus B $ . Then we have an equivalence relation on $ B \\uplus B $ according to which $ y _ 0 $ and $ y _ 1 $ are equivalent iff $ y $ belongs to the image of $ f $ , and no other equivalences exist besides the reflexive ones. (More explicitly, $ y _ i $ and $ z _ j $ are equal iff $ y = z $ and $ i = j $ or $ y = z $ and $ y = f ( x ) $ for some $ x $ .) Then $ C $ is the quotient of $ B \\uplus B $ under this equivalence relation. The cokernel pair also comes equipped with two inclusion/quotient maps from $ B $ , while I'll call $ k _ 0 $ and $ k _ 1 $ ; $ k _ i $ maps $ y $ to the equivalence class of $ y _ i $ in $ C $ . Given an element $ x $ in $ A $ , $ k _ 0 ( f ( x ) ) = k _ 1 ( f ( x ) ) $ in $ C $ because $ f ( x ) $ is in the image of $ f $ . So since $ f $ is an epimorphism, $ k _ 0 = k _ 1 $ . This means that for every element $ y $ of $ B $ , $ k _ 0 ( y ) = k _ 1 ( y ) $ , so $ y $ is in the image of $ f $ . So $ f $ is surjective."}], "comments": {"question": [{"id": 447850, "post_id": 178778, "score": 2, "creation_date": "2014-08-18T10:24:21.723", "user_id": 21051, "text": "Given the epimorphism $f$ define $g:Y\\to\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$ by $g(y)=1$ if $y\\in f(X)$ and $g(y)=0$ else.

But I aim to summarise the paper for a non-expert audience and I want them to be able to “Google” modern terminology to find helpful resources. My problem is that I don't know the terminology myself: I'm just a grunt that uses definitions as they are given. I enjoy algebraic taxonomy, but I'm just a tourist. So any insight you, dear reader, can add would be most appreciated. I'd also like to keep from embarrassing myself to an audience of mathematicians who may read my thesis. TL;DR Assume herein that $(, ⊗, 1_)$ is a cartesian monoidal category with finite coproducts. Gougen's main definitions and theorems rest on two isomorphisms: $$ \\textbf{Act}^{X^\\ast} ≅ \\textbf{Mond}^X \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\textbf{Act}_•^{X^\\ast} ≅ \\textbf{Mod}^X $$ where $\\textbf{Act}^M$ is the category of (right) monoid actions for an internal monoid $M ∈ \\textbf{Mon}_$ $\\textbf{Mond}^X$ is the category of “ $X$ -monadic algebras”, which as far as I can tell, are just plain algebras of the endofunctor $(- ⊗ X) \\colon \\rightarrow $ . Goguen makes no explicit use of monads, except to invoke their name. $\\textbf{Act}_•^{M}$ is the category of “pointed” right $M$ -actions, which is an $M$ -action $S ⊗ M \\rightarrow S$ with a global element $1_ \\rightarrow S$ . $\\textbf{Mod}^X$ , the category of “pointed” $X$ -monadic algebras, which he identifies as $X$ -modules. $(-)^*$ is a functor from $$ to free monoid objects in $\\textbf{Mon}_$ . Looking in nLab, a module object is exactly what Goguen calls an $M$ -action! (Except that nLab describes a left action.) In fact, nLab says that module objects are alternatively called action objects . So I'd like to keep the name $M$ -action and the category $\\textbf{Act}^M_$ , since it is evocative of my intended use. But would like to rename $X$ -monadic algebra to $(- ⊗ X)$ -algebra (a plain ol' functor algebra) and then a “pointed” $(- ⊗ X)$ -algebra is a $1 ⊕ (- ⊗ X)$ -algebra. My concern is that there is some devil in the details. The isomorphisms above are specifically on $X^\\ast$ , which, of course, can be forgotten back to $$ to form the basis for a list-monad (once the relevant natural transformations are defined). Questions Any idea why Goguen uses that definition for a module? In the minds of algebraists, does it invoke some intuition from the algebraic notion of a module that isn't obvious to me? Do my proposed changes in nomenclature make sense? If so, are they an improvement to any audience you could imagine, or am I making too much of things? The relevant definitions are below. Goguen's definitions The specific paper is Goguen's (1975) “Discrete-Time Machines in Closed Monoidal Categories. I” Also assume the standard definition of internal monoids/monoid objects giving the category $\\textbf{Mon}_$ Free monoids $(M^\\ast, ⧺, ι₀)$ are defined in the usual way, with $X^\\ast = \\bigoplus_{n ∈ ℕ} X^{⊗ n}$ along with concatenation ( $⧺$ ) and unit $ι₀$ as the 0-th coproduct injection---shown to witness a free-forgetful adjunction. (I've modernized the notation a bit.) Now here is the series of definitions that gives me pause: Given $(M, μ, e) ∈ \\textbf{Mon}_$ , a right $M$ -action is a $$ -arrow $ \\colon S ⊗ M \\rightarrow S$ for $S ∈ $ and satisfying two commutative diagrams that amount to an association pentagon and unitor triangle that enforce the preservation of the monoid: where $α$ is the associator, $ρ$ is the right unitor of $$ 's monoidal structure. Homomorphisms are $h \\colon S \\rightarrow S′$ with committing triangles: $α′ ∘ (h ⊗ M) = h ∘ α$ , giving the induced category $\\textbf{Act}^{M}$ . This definition is consonant with modern literature, so I'm satisfied with it. Let $X ∈ $ . Then an $X$ -monadic algebra is a $$ -arrow $δ \\colon S ⊗ X \\rightarrow S$ with homomorphisms $h \\colon S \\rightarrow S′$ with commuting rectangles: $δ′ ∘ (h ⊗ X) = h ∘ δ$ giving the induced category $\\textbf{Mond}^X$ . I would package this as a tuple, drop the monad talk , and call it an algebra of the endofunctor $(- ⊗ X)$ . Then, $\\textbf{Mond}^X$ is just $(- ⊗ X)\\text{-}\\textbf{Alg}$ , the category of algebras of the functor. I wonder if he calls it monadic because (even if he doesn't say so) the fact that $$\\textbf{Act}^{X^\\ast} ≅ \\textbf{Mond}^X$$ and $(-)^\\ast$ induces a monad. A pointed $M$ -action is a tuple $(S, α, σ)$ where $α$ is an $M$ -action and $σ$ is a global element. Homomorphisms of these additionally satisfy a triangle for preserving the base-point. An $X$ -module is a tuple $(X, S, δ, σ)$ where $δ$ is an $X$ -monadic algebra and $σ$ is a global element $(1_, S)$ . Homomorphisms of these additionally satisfy a triangle for preserving the base-points. This gives the category $\\textbf{Mod}_$ .

Incidentally, the HBT is important in this because it allows one to show that the unit of a monoidal structure on LCTVS has to be $\\mathbb{R}$. The unit has to satisfy the property that $\\dim \\mathcal{L}(X) = 1$. With HBT, this is just $\\mathbb{R}$.

Hence $\\alpha$ splits, and so $P$ is injective. Therefore all projectives are injective, and since every object is a subobject of a projective, there are enough injectives.

The map naturally factors through $\\pi_0(\\mathcal T)$ (again equivariantly). The naïve guess that $\\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ acts transitively on the fibres is not correct (even for the factored map in (2)). (If I understand your notation correctly, $\\pi_0(\\mathcal T)$ means objects up to isomorphism, and not the pro-representable left adjoint $\\pi_0$ to $\\nu^* \\colon \\mathbf{Set} \\to \\mathcal T$ , where $\\nu \\colon \\mathcal T \\to \\mathbf{Set}$ is the terminal morphism.) For (1) and (2), note that an isomorphism $\\phi \\colon G \\to H$ induces a map $H^1(\\mathcal T,G) \\to H^1(\\mathcal T,H)$ that can be constructed on torsors as follows: given a $G$ -torsor $m \\colon G \\times V \\to V$ , let $H$ act on $V$ via $$H \\times V \\xrightarrow{(\\phi^{-1},1)} G \\times V \\xrightarrow m V.$$ To see that this indeed induces the pushforward $H^1(\\mathcal T,G) \\to H^1(\\mathcal T,H)$ , one can use for instance use cocycles. This shows that the map $H^1(\\mathcal T,G)/{\\operatorname{Aut}(G)} \\to \\pi_0(\\mathcal T)$ taking $G \\times V \\to V$ to $V$ is well-defined.

One easily sees that $g$ is not injective in general; for instance $V$ and $V \\amalg V$ have points over the same $U \\in \\mathcal T$ , since $V$ and $V \\amalg V$ mutually admit maps to each other. In the locally finite case that you're interested in, this type of example does not occur for degree reasons, but you could look at things like $V \\amalg V \\amalg W$ and $V \\amalg W \\amalg W$ . (I do not have an example where there are $G$ -torsor structures on these, but I see no reason why this couldn't exist.)

An element $a \\in \\mathbf Q^\\times$ gives a class $[a] \\in \\mathbf Q^\\times/(\\mathbf Q^\\times)^n \\cong H^1(\\mathbf Q,\\boldsymbol \\mu_n)$ , which as $\\boldsymbol\\mu_n$ -torsor is given by the scheme $V_a = V(x^n-a) \\subseteq \\mathbf A^1_{\\mathbf Q}$ with the obvious $\\boldsymbol\\mu_n$ -action. Example. Let $n = 8$ and consider the elements $a = -1$ and $b = -16$ in $\\mathbf Q$ . Then we claim that $V_a \\cong V_b$ as schemes but $[a] \\neq [b]$ in $H^1(\\mathbf Q,\\boldsymbol\\mu_8)/{\\operatorname{Aut}(\\boldsymbol\\mu_8)}$ .

In $\\mathbf Q(\\zeta_{16})$ , the element $\\beta = (1+i)\\zeta_{16}$ satisfies $\\beta^8 = -16$ , showing that $x^8+16$ has a root in $\\mathbf Q(\\zeta_{16})$ . Since $\\beta^4 = -4i$ , we conversely see that $i$ and therefore $\\zeta_{16} = \\tfrac{\\beta}{(1+i)}$ is in $\\mathbf Q(\\beta)$ , so $\\mathbf Q(\\zeta_8) = \\mathbf Q(\\beta)$ and $V_a \\cong V_b$ .

If we suppose that we already know the monoidal structure on $Ab(C)$ (category of abelian group objects in $C$ ), then this is the same as an $R$ -action/module when viewing $R$ as a monoid in the monoidal category $Ab(C)$ . Examples/Motivation: if $C=\\mathsf{Set}$ , then $R\\mathrm{Mod}(C)$ are ordinary $R$ -modules, if $C$ is a convenient category of topological spaces, then $\\mathbb{R}$ -module objects are essentially (but not quite) topological vector spaces, if $C=\\mathsf{Difflg}$ is the category of diffeological spaces, then $\\mathbb{R}$ -module objects are exactly diffeological vector spaces , if $C=\\mathsf{Set}^{\\Delta}$ , then $\\mathbb{Z}\\mathrm{Mod}(C)$ is the category of simplicial abelian groups. if $C=\\mathsf{Cond(Set)}$ is the category of condensed sets, then $\\mathbb{R}$ -module objects are condensed vector spaces (see e.g. here ), and $\\mathbb{Z}$ -module objects are condensed abelian groups, further examples: bornological vector spaces, internal $R$ -modules in a topos, etc. I would mainly like a simultaneous construction of the closed symmetric monoidal structure for all of these cases. The main problem: What I haven't found a good reference for is the fact that the forgetful functor $R\\mathrm{Mod}(C) \\to C$ is monadic and that the resulting monad is a symmetric monoidal (equivalently, commutative strong) monad on $C$ (with respect to the cartesian monoidal structure on $C$ ). EDIT : The main problem, reformulated: The main problem reduces to the assertion: the forgetful functor $\\mathrm{Ab}(C) \\to C$ is monadic and that the resulting monad is a symmetric monoidal (equivalently, commutative strong) monad on $C$ (with respect to the cartesian monoidal structure on $C$ ).

First of all, David's answer does provide detailed references for the well-poweredness, (countable) (co-)completeness, and regularity of $\\mathrm{RMod}(C)$ , once we know that the forgetful functor $\\mathrm{RMod}(C)\\to C$ is monadic. The point that's missing is a construction of the closed symmetric monoidal structure on $\\mathrm{RMod}(C)$ . David makes the right suggestion to use the following theorem (at least I assume this is what he means; and this is what Hovey rightfully calls \"well known\" in his paper): Theorem 1. Let $D$ be a closed symmetric monoidal category and let $M$ be a monoid in $D$ . Then the category of $M$ -actions (perhaps confusingly called $M$ -modules by Hovey and others, cf. Morgan Roger's comment) is a closed symmetric monoidal category. In the above theorem, take $D=\\mathrm{CMon}(C)$ the category of commutative monoids in $C$ , and suppose that we already know the (\"canonical\") symmetric monoidal structure on $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)$ (this tensor product on $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)$ is not given by the coproduct in $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)$ /the product in $C$ !). Then, indeed, it will turn out that a commutative semiring $R$ in $C$ is the same thing as a commutative monoid in $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)$ . So applying the above theorem to $M:=R$ reduces the construction of the closed symmetric monoidal structure on $\\mathrm{RMod}(C)$ to constructing one on $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)$ . So we need to show: Theorem 2. [no reference found] Let $C$ be a finitely complete, countably cocomplete closed cartesian closed category. Then $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)$ is a closed symmetric monoidal category. To prove this, we cannot apply Theorem 1 , since a) $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)$ is not generally a category of $M$ -actions for some monoid $M$ in a symmetric monoidal category, in a non-trivial way, and b) Theorem 1 takes a general closed symmetric monoidal category as input, but Theorem 2 is false for $C$ a general closed symmetric monoidal category. For a), take $C=\\mathsf{Set}$ , then $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)$ is the category of commutative monoids. This is indeed trivially the category of $\\mathbb{N}$ -actions/modules in the symmetric monoidal category $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)$ , with the tensor product given by the tensor product of commutative monoids in the usual sense -- but for this we already have to know the monoidal structure on $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)$ . For b), take the closed symmetric monoidal category $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathsf{Ab}$ of abelian groups. Then $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)=\\mathrm{Ring}$ is the category of commutative rings. This is not a closed monoidal category in any useful way. In particular, $\\mathrm{Ring}$ is not closed monoidal with respect to its coproduct. In the language of Hovey's paper, we are interested in a closed monoidal structure on $I$ - algebras (where $I$ is the tensor unit), not on modules over some monoid. Instead of Theorem 1, we will at least implicitly have to use: Theorem 3. [Corollary 6.5.4, Brandenburg ] Let $C$ be closed symmetric monoidal category and let $T$ be a symmetric monoidal monad on $C$ . Then the category $C^T$ of $T$ -algebras (also sometimes called $T$ -modules, to add to the confusion) is a closed symmetric monoidal category. Remark. The tensor product and internal hom are constructed in a way that is analogous to the classical case of $R$ -modules over a commutative ring $R$ . This is why using Theorem 3 at least implicitly is likely unavoidable, as it is already implicitly used in the case $C=\\mathsf{Set}$ . Now, in order to be able to employ Theorem 3, we will have to show i) that the forgetful functor $\\mathrm{CMon}(C)\\to \\mathsf{C}$ has a left adjoint $S$ , ii) that this forgetful functor is morover monadic, iii) that the resulting monad, denoted also by $S$ (by a slight abuse of notation), admits the structure of symmetric monoidal monad. For i), a reference can be found in [Lemma 4.4.5, Brandenburg ]. Explicitly, $S$ is given by, $$ S(X) := \\coprod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} X^n/S_n, $$ where $X^n/S_n$ is the coequaliser obtained from the action of the symmetric group $S_n$ by \"permuting the factors\".

If you have free abelian groups, then it is enough to have coequalisers of abelian groups to construct the tensor product, but even the construction of coequalisers of abelian groups can be quite non-trivial. I'm more familiar with the case where the base category $\\mathcal{V}$ is cartesian closed, so I'll briefly mention the extra structures we need to get tensor products in $\\textbf{Ab}(\\mathcal{V})$: If $\\mathcal{V}$ has countable colimits and is a well-powered regular category, then the forgetful functor $\\textbf{Ab}(\\mathcal{V}) \\to \\mathcal{V}$ is strictly monadic. (In particular, it has a left adjoint.) A proof can be extracted by chasing the references in theorem 2.4.21 of my notes . Moreover these hypotheses suffice to show $\\textbf{Ab}(\\mathcal{V})$ has coequalisers for all parallel pairs: combine proposition 2.4.7 (ii) and theorem 2.4.21 (ii). Once we know that $\\textbf{Ab}(\\mathcal{V})$ has coequalisers of reflexive pairs and that $\\textbf{Ab}(\\mathcal{V}) \\to \\mathcal{V}$ is monadic, we can construct tensor products the usual way using generators and relations.
