Following is my attempt. Please feel free to comment not only on accuracy, but on general style like readability et cetera. Another question: Is it possible to prove it using definition of points, not considering what is in the set? I tried (And succeeded I think) to prove by constructing a $g:B→C$ such that $g∘f=h$ as following: Definition 1: Range of mapping $f:A→B$ is range(f), a subset of B, such that for every $b \\in range(f)$, there exists at least 1 $a \\in A$ such that $f(a) = b$ and there exists no b' such that $f(a' \\in A) = b' \\in B$ and $b \\notin range(f)$. Definition 2: If $f:A→B$, then preimage of $b \\in range(f)$ is a set $P_b,_f$, a subset of $A$, such that, for every $a \\in P_b,_f$, $f(a)=b$. Lemma 1 For every $b \\in Range(f)$, there exists $c \\in Range(h)$ such that $$P_b,_f \\subseteq P_c,_h$$ Proof (Lemma 1) Suppose Lemma 1 is false, then that means that there exists at least 1 $b \\in Range(f)$ such that there does not exist $c \\in Range(h)$ such that $$P_b,_f \\subseteq P_c,_h$$ Note that $|P_b,_f| > 1$. It cannot be zero, because $b \\in Range(f)$. It cannot be 1 because every element of $A$ is mapped to some element of $C$ via $h$, which means that $$P_b,_f \\subseteq P_c,_h$$. Suppose $a_1, a_2 \\in P_b,_f$. According to proposition M, if $$f(a_1)=f(a_2)$$ then $$h(a_1) = h(a_2)$$ Lets say $$h(a_1) = h(a_2)=c$$ hence $a_1, a_2 \\in P_c,_h$. If $|P_b,_f|=2$, we are done because it contradicts our initial assumption that Lemma 1 is false. If $|P_b,_f|>2$, we repeat the process by replacing $a_2$ with some other element $a_3 \\in P_b,_f$, arriving at conclusion that $a_1, a_3 \\in P_c,_h$. Hence, eventually, one will arrive at a contradiction. Thus, Lemma 1 is True. Lemma 2 If there exists $b \\in Range(f)$ such that there exists $c_1, c_2 \\in Range(h)$ such that, $P_b,_f \\subseteq P_{c_1},_h$ and $P_b,_f \\subseteq P_{c_2},_h$ then, $$c_1 = c_2$$ Proof (Lemma 2) Suppose, Lemma 2 is false. Suppose $a \\in P_b,_f$. Then, $ a \\in P_{c_1},_h$ and $a \\in P_{c_2},_h$. But, by definition of a function which has $h(a) = c_1$ and $h(a) = c_2$ does not exist. Hence, it is contradiction. Thus, lemma 1 must be true. Definition of g $$g: B \\rightarrow C$$ for every $b \\in range(f)$, map b to c such that $$P_b,_f \\subseteq P_{c},_h$$. Note it does not matter that, elements that are not in $range(f)$ are mapped to what element in C. Corollary 1 Proposition N is True. Proof (Corollary 1) Suppose Proposition N is False. Then there exists $a \\in A$ such that $$g∘f(a) \\ne h(a)$$ $$g(f(a)) \\ne h(a)$$ Suppose $f(a) = b \\in range(f)$, $$g(b) \\ne h(a)$$ Suppose $ g(b) = c_1$ and $h(a) = c_2$, $$c_1 \\ne c_2$$ Note that $ a \\in P_{c_2},_h$. Hence, $a \\notin P_{c_1},_h$, which contradicts definition of $g$. Hence, Corollary 1 must be True.

In a similar vein, there should be a save feature which allows me to read/write from a file and get the exact state of the diagrams (x/y positions included) or share it with others. By the way, those are run-of-the-mill features, not specific to Category Theory. I mean, this is really solid if that's all it needs to have! Some polish is needed, but it's a piece of software with a well-define purpose and user base. The rest could be under \"want\", but are not essential. Should Have: Extensible commuting, on arrow/functor/natural map/beyond level. This is extremely difficult, but the alternative is custom creation of cones, limits, exponent maps, subobject classifiers, etc. Maybe you could manage this programmatically through specific kinds of Kan Extensions. Keyboard shortcuts. Consider the user with motor function impairment, who might not be able to move the mouse very easily. Accessibility also helps power users, who may want their hands to stay on the keyboard for more inputs-per-second. Could Have: Diagram commutativity designation. One of the problems I have when studying category theory in general is how difficult it is to figure out whether a diagram is commuting or not. Which diagram has commutativity? Should all the commuting arrows be explicitly shown? Where to draw the line on too much \"ink\"? Library of Kan Extensions. Label drawing. This is a surprisingly difficult problem. Won't Have: One of your questions was: \"Should I have functors fill in recursively?\" Some people might like that, some people might feel that the software is taking over for them (I didn't read this whole article, but I think it's related: the experience of agency in HCI ). Besides being overbearing, it might be impossible; imagine a functor loop, and having the categories spam objects and arrows until the software crashes. As a developer, I have a couple of pieces of advice for the development process. Python is a great prototyping language. As you move forward, you should consider using a statically typed language. I know folks who work on large projects in Python, and they always complain about not knowing what types they're getting from which functions, and runtime errors when dealing with classes that they're not sure about, and the constant referencing of attributes and methods that cannot be automatically pulled by the IDE. Save yourself the pain. Open-source the project. Nothing is sadder when a promising project like is abandoned without details on how to run it, setting up environment, and so on. Community-building is tough. But the interest is there. I look forward to the progress on this software."}], "comments": {"question": [{"id": 5877288, "post_id": 2849246, "score": 1, "creation_date": "2018-07-13T05:14:42.053", "user_id": 6622, "text": "I don't do a lot of category theory, so I won't be using it -- but I liked the part where the functor gets applied to the entire diagram automatically :-)"}, {"id": 5877305, "post_id": 2849246, "score": 0, "creation_date": "2018-07-13T05:27:35.903", "user_id": 26327, "text": "@joriki thank you for your positive feedback.

(a variant of) Yoneda's lemma tells you that $\\alpha$ can be encoded as a \"nice\" element $\\beta$ of $\\varprojlim_{i\\in I}\\morc(L,F(i))$ . Specifically, the fact $\\alpha$ is an isomorphism tells you that $(\\beta,L)$ is initial in the category of elements of the functor $\\varprojlim_{i\\in I}\\morc(-,F(i))$ . If you don't know what that means, that's fine; in concrete terms, the isomorphism tells you that for any $X$ and $\\gamma\\in\\varprojlim_{i\\in I}\\morc(X,F(i))$ there shall be some unique arrow $\\delta:X\\to L$ such that $(\\varprojlim_{i\\in I}\\morc(-,F(i)))(\\delta)(\\beta)=\\gamma$ . $\\beta=\\alpha_L(1_L)$ and the corresponding $\\delta$ shall be $\\alpha_X^{-1}(\\gamma)$ . Take a moment to convince yourself this is really true. I assume you use the definition of limit via universal cones. To unwrap what the above paragraph is saying into a proof about existence of limits we just need to see that $\\varprojlim_{i\\in I}\\morc(-,F(i))$ is isomorphic to the functor of cones i.e. it maps $X$ to the set of all cones from $X$ to the diagram $F$ and acts on arrows $f:X\\to Y$ by taking a cone $\\varphi:\\Delta Y\\implies F$ to $\\varphi\\circ f$ . Then the universality of $(\\beta,L)$ tells you in fact that there is some universal cone $\\hat{\\beta}$ from $L$ to $F$ , and the contravariance flips the initiality of $(\\beta,L)$ into terminality of $(\\hat{\\beta},L)$ (! intuitively speaking... more precisely you can use the explicit property of $\\beta$ that I mentioned to conclude) which is exactly what we need as per the definition of a limit. I hope you know the explicit construction of limits in the category of sets (see bottom of this post). Using this, I see that (... for any fixed choice of limit functor $\\varprojlim_{i\\in i}$ , I will get something isomorphic to the construction I describe): $$\\varprojlim_{i\\in I}\\morc(X,F(i))\\\\\\cong\\left\\{(\\lambda_i)_{i\\in I}\\in\\prod_{i\\in I}\\morc(X,F(i)):\\forall(f:i\\to j\\text{ in $I$}),\\,\\morc(1,F(f))(\\lambda_i)=\\lambda_j\\right\\}$$ Notice each $\\lambda_\\bullet$ is just an arrow $X\\to F(\\bullet)$ and the condition on the right is saying exactly that $F(f)\\circ\\lambda_i=\\lambda_j$ always holds (when $f:i\\to j$ ) so this is precisely the statement that the $(\\lambda_i)_{i\\in I}$ define a cone over $F$ with apex $X$ . Once you realise this, take another moment to convince yourself this correspondence of elements of $\\varprojlim_{i\\in I}\\morc(X,F(i))$ with cones is natural in $X$ (how is $\\varprojlim$ defined as a functor on arrows? What is the limiting cone in the explicit construction of limits in sets, and what does that say about how this construction behaves when it acts on some $g:X\\to Y)$ ? Reading your question again, it seems that maybe you're not happy with that formula after all. In general for a functor $G:\\mathsf{C}\\to\\mathsf{Set}$ , where $\\mathsf{C}$ is small, $\\varprojlim_{\\varsigma\\in\\mathsf{C}}G$ can be constructed as: $$\\left\\{(x_\\varsigma)_{\\varsigma\\in\\mathsf{C}}\\in\\prod_{\\varsigma\\in\\mathsf{C}}G(\\varsigma):\\forall(f:\\varsigma\\to\\varsigma')\\text{ in $\\mathsf{C}$},\\,G(f)(x_\\varsigma)=x_{\\varsigma'}\\right\\}$$ You can justify this (I leave this as an excellent conceptual exercise) by thinking: well, if the limit really exists - call it $L$ - I know $L\\cong\\mathsf{Set}(\\ast,L)$ where $\\ast$ is some singleton set, and then I know arrows $\\ast\\to L$ should be the same thing as cones over $G$ with apex $\\ast$ ... but arrows $\\ast\\to G(\\varsigma)$ , for any $\\varsigma$ , are just elements of $G(\\varsigma)$ . What does the cone condition say about these (families of) elements?"}], "comments": {"question": [], "answers": {"4797123": [{"id": 10201721, "post_id": 4797123, "score": 1, "creation_date": "2023-10-31T01:05:57.643", "user_id": 1238391, "text": "you are amazing, I am wondering if you could explain your third paragraph further, after \"specifically\" to the end of the same paragraph?

We can prove that the above transformations are not the identity. The function $c$ is a linear map from the underlying field $k$ into $V\\otimes Y$ . It is linear, so watch where $c(1)$ goes: it goes into the tensor product of a subspace in $V$ and a subspace in $Y$ . Both of these are finite dimensional subspaces because $k$ is finite-dimensional. So we have $V \\xrightarrow{c\\otimes\\text{id}} V^\\prime \\otimes Y^\\prime \\otimes V \\rightarrow V^\\prime $ where $V^\\prime$ and $Y^\\prime$ are finite-dimensional.
