But I would really love to know that I am making a mistake here, and there is some other information.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it seems to me that the reason, that some people say, that the Euler characteristics of CY 3-folds could be bounded is purely empirical. Namely, the search for CY 3-folds is going for 20 years already. Since then a lot of new families were found. We know that mirror symmetry started with this symmetric table of numbers \"($h^{1,1}, h^{2,1})$\", and the curious fact is that, according to Maximillian, what happened to this table in 20 years -- it has not got any wider in 20 years, it just got denser. The famous picture can be found on page 9 of the following notes of Dominic Joyce <a href=\"http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~joyce/SympGeom2009/SGlect13+14.pdf\">http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~joyce/SympGeom2009/SGlect13+14.pdf</a> . So, this means that we do find new families of CY manifolds, all the time. But the values of their Hodge numbers for some reason stay in the same region. Of course this could easily mean that we are just lacking a good construction. </p>\n\n<p>Final remark is that in the first version of this question it was proposed to consider complex analytic manifolds with $c_1=0$. If we don't impose condition of been Kahler, then already in complex dimension 2 there is infinite number of topological types, given by Kodaira surfaces, they are elliptic bundles over elliptic curve. In complex dimension 3 Tian have shown that for every $n&gt;1$ there is a holomorphic structure on the connected sum of n copies of $S^3\\times S^3$, with a non-vanishing holomorphic form. Surely these manifolds are non-Kahler. So if you want to speak about any finiteness, you need to discuss say, Kahler 3-folds with non-vanishing holomorphic volume form, but not all complex analytic ones.</p>\n", "body_text": "This is a very good question, and I would really love to know the answer since its current state seems to be quite obscure.

But I would really love to know that I am making a mistake here, and there is some other information. Now, it seems to me that the reason, that some people say, that the Euler characteristics of CY 3-folds could be bounded is purely empirical. Namely, the search for CY 3-folds is going for 20 years already. Since then a lot of new families were found. We know that mirror symmetry started with this symmetric table of numbers \"($h^{1,1}, h^{2,1})$\", and the curious fact is that, according to Maximillian, what happened to this table in 20 years -- it has not got any wider in 20 years, it just got denser. The famous picture can be found on page 9 of the following notes of Dominic Joyce http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~joyce/SympGeom2009/SGlect13+14.pdf . So, this means that we do find new families of CY manifolds, all the time. But the values of their Hodge numbers for some reason stay in the same region. Of course this could easily mean that we are just lacking a good construction. Final remark is that in the first version of this question it was proposed to consider complex analytic manifolds with $c_1=0$. If we don't impose condition of been Kahler, then already in complex dimension 2 there is infinite number of topological types, given by Kodaira surfaces, they are elliptic bundles over elliptic curve. In complex dimension 3 Tian have shown that for every $n>1$ there is a holomorphic structure on the connected sum of n copies of $S^3\\times S^3$, with a non-vanishing holomorphic form. Surely these manifolds are non-Kahler. So if you want to speak about any finiteness, you need to discuss say, Kahler 3-folds with non-vanishing holomorphic volume form, but not all complex analytic ones."}, {"id": 12290, "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/a/12290", "parent_id": 12284, "score": 13, "creation_date": "2010-01-19T07:55:09.633", "owner_user_id": 874, "body_html": "<p>The smallest known Euler characteristic of a Calabi-Yau threefold is -960.

For the example you require, let us consider the trivial line bundle $X \\times \\mathbb{C}$: any global 1-form $A: TX \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ gives a connection defined by $\\nabla_{X}V = \\partial_{X}V + A(X) \\cdot V$. The curvature is $F = dA$, which is trivial in cohomology, but not as a single form in general. Therefore, if $A$ is not closed, you have a local anomaly even on the trivial bundle. If $dA = 0$, you can project it to a cohomology class in $H^{1}(X,\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z})$, and this class is the flat holonomy. For example, if $X = S^{1}$, for any global 1-form $A$ which is not integral, i.e. such that $\\int_{S^{1}}A \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$ ($A = \\alpha dt$ with $\\alpha \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$), you have a global anomaly but not a local one.

Footnotes (by Born) on pp. 583, 585 of the famous 1926 Dreimännerarbeit (see commented translation pp. 351, 352) immediately identified Hilbert’s work on linear operators as the correct framework for QM, and are a literal blueprint for its extension to unbounded operators by von Neumann. If this, and Weyl’s group reformulation of $[P,Q]=I$ , are not contributions of functional analysis, then I don’t know what could be! Consider also that, as far as could be determined at this question , the first two times our very phrase “linear algebra” (I don’t mean the thing ) appears in the literature are ( b,c ) In Hermann Weyl’s 1919 book on general relativity; the phrase didn’t catch on then. In Hermann Weyl’s 1928 book on quantum mechanics: then it caught on. So QM and FA both played a role in establishing the other as a field of study. a. Which I would qualify to: FA (some say linear algebra) “is essentially the same thing” as those parts of QM we understand . b.

Schur's lemma says: An intertwiner $M : \\mathbb V\\longrightarrow\\mathbb V'$ of two irreducibles of a group is either zero or isomorphism.

(Well, there some other relations with integrable systems, but they are not so central, imho). </p>\n\n<p>Let me try to explain this in more details. Consider universal enveloping $U(g)$,\nit is an algebra with generators $e_k$ and relations $[e_{k}, e_{l} ] = c^{i}_{kl} e_l $,\nlet us insert parameter $h$ here: $[e_{k}, e_{l} ] = h c^{i}_{kl} e_l$.\nFor $h=0$ we have just the commutative algebra - denote it $S(g)$, for any non-zero $h$ this algebra is isomorphic to $U(g)$. </p>\n\n<p>Now let us look at $h$  \"very small\", i.e. we can formally take $h^2=0$, what will see from \nthe structure of non-commutative algebra $U(g)$ reduces to commutative algebra $S(g)$\n\"plus\" a Poisson bracket on it. </p>\n\n<p>So the moral is that \n<strong>Non-commutative algebra, when non-commutativity tends to zero is commutative algebra with Poisson bracket.</strong> (It is called classical limit).</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>big goal of quantization</strong> program\nis try to express everything about non-commutative algebra in terms of<br>\nPoisson algebra. The reason is that Poisson algebra is something more simple than non-commutative algebra.</p>\n\n<p>In particular we can be interested in description of irreps of non-commutative algebra.\nWhat are the corresponding objects for the Poisson algebra ?\nAnswer - symplectic leaves.\n<strong>Observation:  the symplectic leaves of $S(g)$ (classical limit of $U(g)$) are exactly the coadjoint orbits.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So this puts the orbit method - in more general framework of quantization. Where one may hope to describe the irreps of quantized algebras via symplectic leaves in Poisson algebra.\nThe problem is that such construction does not always exists neither for $U(g)$, nor for general quantum algebras, at least it does not exist in some simple sense, and big activity is to understand what are the borders between true statements from fakes, it is neverending activity. </p>\n\n<p>It is worth to remark that such point of view on orbit method is not the original one, but emerged later when quantization theory begin to develop.</p>\n\n<p>The basic question of representation theory are calculating characters, induction-restriction, tensor products. The natural question:  what are the parallel constructions\nin the Poisson world (i.e. symplectic geometry) ? how representation theory questions can be answered with the help of symplectic geometry ? \nThere are ideological answers to these questions and again it is neverending game to make \"ideology\" to theorems or to counter-examples.</p>\n\n<p>Some MO-questions with more details on quantization: <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/107323/problem-of-quantization-state-of-the-art/107331#107331\">Q1</a>, <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/102313/classical-limit-of-quantum-mechanics/102354#102354\">Q2</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> What is naive quantization without  metaplectic correction. (It is better to call it correction (imho), but not quantization, but people use both). </p>\n\n<p>So, our basic wish is to construct a irreducible representation of $U(g)$ (or more generally of some quantized algebra $\\hat A$). \nThe \"naive recipe\" is the following:</p>\n\n<p>1) take symplectic leaf </p>\n\n<p>2) Consider algebra of functions on it and split it into two halves \"P-part\" and \"Q-part</p>\n\n<p>3) The <strong>representation space is ----- all functions of \"Q\"-variable</strong>,\nand representation is constructed as:   Q-variables act as multiplication operators,\nwhile \"P\" acts as $\\partial_Q$. </p>\n\n<p>Now, what I mean \"split in two parts\", informally you should think as follows Darboux theorem says that symplectic  form is $dp\\wedge dq$ is appropriate coordinates, so \nyou have these \"p\" and \"q\" as my splitting. The problem is that Darboux is local result,\nand you need something more complicated to make it work, look at the word \"polarization\" for more information on that.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> Towards metaplectic correction. </p>\n\n<p>In the previous item I wrote that naively we should take \"half of functions\" on the orbit(symplectic leaf) as a Hilbert space.</p>\n\n<p>This actually a point to be corrected. </p>\n\n<p>We should not take \"functions\", but should take \"half-forms\". </p>\n\n<p>The simplest motivation is that we want to have a Hilbert space, so we need to have an inner product, but there is no canonical one on the functions.\nBut if we take half-forms: $f(q) \\sqrt{dq}$ we have the canonical inner product: \n$\\int fg \\sqrt{dq}^2 = \\int fg dq $.</p>\n\n<p>So the metaplectic correction is story is how to introduce these \"half-forms\" into a business in an appropriate way.\nSome time ago <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0409005\" rel=\"noreferrer\">we exercised</a> with quantization of sphere $S^2$ and argued that in general\nthis should be consistent with the Duflo isomorphism.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>4)</strong> Finally to your main question: \"quantization of coadjoint orbits\".</p>\n\n<p>Well, sorry, I cannot say much. The general ideology here is that we should take\na coadjoint orbit and try to construct irrep. Kirillov done it in 1962 for nilpotent groups, for solvable much progress achieved later. For semisimples - generic orbits - no problems, but for many orbits it is impossible (or at least in some naive sense impossib).

Kirillov himself : \"In conclusion I want to express the hope that the orbit method becomes for my readers a source of thoughts and inspirations as it has been for me during the last thirty-ve years\" Sorry I cannot find another much more colorful quote from him, where he says something like orbit method not only produced results on many principal questions of representation theory, but gives informal guidance how to invent new and new results. 1) What is the context of orbit method and why it is related to mathematical physics. Orbit method as a particular case of quantization ideology. I think orbit method should be seen in the context of quantization and roughly speaking its relation to the mathematical physics is that orbit method is particular example of \"quantization program\". (Well, there some other relations with integrable systems, but they are not so central, imho). Let me try to explain this in more details. Consider universal enveloping $U(g)$, it is an algebra with generators $e_k$ and relations $[e_{k}, e_{l} ] = c^{i}_{kl} e_l $, let us insert parameter $h$ here: $[e_{k}, e_{l} ] = h c^{i}_{kl} e_l$. For $h=0$ we have just the commutative algebra - denote it $S(g)$, for any non-zero $h$ this algebra is isomorphic to $U(g)$. Now let us look at $h$ \"very small\", i.e. we can formally take $h^2=0$, what will see from the structure of non-commutative algebra $U(g)$ reduces to commutative algebra $S(g)$ \"plus\" a Poisson bracket on it. So the moral is that Non-commutative algebra, when non-commutativity tends to zero is commutative algebra with Poisson bracket. (It is called classical limit). The big goal of quantization program is try to express everything about non-commutative algebra in terms of Poisson algebra. The reason is that Poisson algebra is something more simple than non-commutative algebra. In particular we can be interested in description of irreps of non-commutative algebra. What are the corresponding objects for the Poisson algebra ? Answer - symplectic leaves. Observation: the symplectic leaves of $S(g)$ (classical limit of $U(g)$) are exactly the coadjoint orbits. So this puts the orbit method - in more general framework of quantization. Where one may hope to describe the irreps of quantized algebras via symplectic leaves in Poisson algebra. The problem is that such construction does not always exists neither for $U(g)$, nor for general quantum algebras, at least it does not exist in some simple sense, and big activity is to understand what are the borders between true statements from fakes, it is neverending activity. It is worth to remark that such point of view on orbit method is not the original one, but emerged later when quantization theory begin to develop. The basic question of representation theory are calculating characters, induction-restriction, tensor products. The natural question: what are the parallel constructions in the Poisson world (i.e. symplectic geometry) ? how representation theory questions can be answered with the help of symplectic geometry ? There are ideological answers to these questions and again it is neverending game to make \"ideology\" to theorems or to counter-examples. Some MO-questions with more details on quantization: Q1 , Q2 . 2) What is naive quantization without metaplectic correction. (It is better to call it correction (imho), but not quantization, but people use both). So, our basic wish is to construct a irreducible representation of $U(g)$ (or more generally of some quantized algebra $\\hat A$). The \"naive recipe\" is the following: 1) take symplectic leaf 2) Consider algebra of functions on it and split it into two halves \"P-part\" and \"Q-part 3) The representation space is ----- all functions of \"Q\"-variable , and representation is constructed as: Q-variables act as multiplication operators, while \"P\" acts as $\\partial_Q$. Now, what I mean \"split in two parts\", informally you should think as follows Darboux theorem says that symplectic form is $dp\\wedge dq$ is appropriate coordinates, so you have these \"p\" and \"q\" as my splitting. The problem is that Darboux is local result, and you need something more complicated to make it work, look at the word \"polarization\" for more information on that. 3) Towards metaplectic correction. In the previous item I wrote that naively we should take \"half of functions\" on the orbit(symplectic leaf) as a Hilbert space. This actually a point to be corrected. We should not take \"functions\", but should take \"half-forms\". The simplest motivation is that we want to have a Hilbert space, so we need to have an inner product, but there is no canonical one on the functions. But if we take half-forms: $f(q) \\sqrt{dq}$ we have the canonical inner product: $\\int fg \\sqrt{dq}^2 = \\int fg dq $. So the metaplectic correction is story is how to introduce these \"half-forms\" into a business in an appropriate way. Some time ago we exercised with quantization of sphere $S^2$ and argued that in general this should be consistent with the Duflo isomorphism. 4) Finally to your main question: \"quantization of coadjoint orbits\". Well, sorry, I cannot say much. The general ideology here is that we should take a coadjoint orbit and try to construct irrep. Kirillov done it in 1962 for nilpotent groups, for solvable much progress achieved later. For semisimples - generic orbits - no problems, but for many orbits it is impossible (or at least in some naive sense impossib). I do not know what is the current state of art. It might be there are some particular classes of orbits where some people think that one can indeed construct irrep and it is in reach and good topic for a paper of a PhD. It might be that ideas by Ranee Brylinski Geometric Quantization of Real Minimal Nilpotent Orbits can be somehow developed... But I do not know much about it, my impression that all left open problems are quite difficult and technical, I would not start this as a PhD. Any case I would ask David Vogan or Jeffrey Adams (he is sometimes on MO). By the way have a look at D. Vogan's REVIEW OF “LECTURES ON THE ORBIT METHOD,” .

The short answer is that a decent notion of \"quantum space\" <em>is</em> a Hilbert space with some extra structure (e.g. a \"spectral triple\" of Connes et al).  For the long answer, I will restrict to (nonlinear) quantum mechanics, which is the nonlinear quantum sigma model in one dimension.</p>\n\n<p>The most basic form of quantum mechanics, after Feynman and well-tuned to be portable to qft, comes from the following picture.  You are given a classical configuration space, which is an abstract manifold with some geometry (a metric to define \"mass\", a 1-form to define \"external magnetic potential\", a function to define \"external electric potential\", etc.).  This geometry in particular determines for you an \"action functional\", which is a function on the paths in this manifold.  Now you define a \"quantum algebra of observables\" as follows.  There is a bijection between quantum observables and classical observables, where \"classical observables\" are functions on the tangent bundle to your space, aka the phase space – so observables are functions of position and velocity.  But the quantum algebra has a much richer algebraic structure than the commutative algebra of functions.  Namely, given two functions <span class=\"math-container\">$f_1$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$f_2$</span>, their product depends on three numbers <span class=\"math-container\">$(t_1, t_2;t_3)$</span>, and is:\n<span class=\"math-container\">$$ (f_1\\star_{(t_1,t_2;t_3)} f_2)(x,v) = \\int_{\\text{paths }\\gamma\\text{ s.t. } (\\gamma,\\dot\\gamma)(t_3) = (x,v)} f(\\gamma(t_1),\\dot\\gamma(t_1))  \\ f(\\gamma(t_2),\\dot\\gamma(t_2))\\ \\exp(\\text{action}(\\gamma)) $$</span>\nThe associativity of this algebra is somewhat subtle, and depends on the times.  You should really think of this as \"<span class=\"math-container\">$f_1$</span> inserted at time <span class=\"math-container\">$t_1$</span> multiplied by <span class=\"math-container\">$f_2$</span> inserted at time <span class=\"math-container\">$t_2$</span>, measured at time <span class=\"math-container\">$t_3$</span>\".  There is a straightforward way to evolve a function inserted at some time <span class=\"math-container\">$t_1$</span> to a <em>different</em> function inserted at any other time <span class=\"math-container\">$t_3$</span>: namely multiply <span class=\"math-container\">$1$</span> at an arbitrary time <span class=\"math-container\">$t_2$</span>.</p>\n\n<p>Now you can do the following.  Since we can evolve functions, <span class=\"math-container\">$t_3$</span> isn't much data – let's just decide <span class=\"math-container\">$t_3 = (t_1 + t_2)/2$</span>, say.  Now let's just consider those situations when <span class=\"math-container\">$t_2 = t_1 + \\epsilon$</span> for very small epsilon.  Dividing by <span class=\"math-container\">$\\epsilon$</span> and taking a limit, you get a usual associative noncommutative algebra.</p>\n\n<p>There is a general notion in mathematics that a \"space\" is the same data as its (commutative) algebra of functions.  Similarly, you can <em>define</em> a \"noncommutative space\" to be the same data as a noncommutative algebra of functions.  Since we're doing integrals, the functions we're working with are the types of functions that appear in measure theory and functional analysis, rather than in geometry.  Just knowing the algebra of measurable functions on a manifold only tells that manifold as a measure space, and all measure spaces are isomorphic, so you should also remember some data of the smooth structure and metric and so on.

In the case at hand, this essentially-unique Hilbert space arises in many ways: for example, the action picks out a symplectic form on the tangent bundle to your configuration space, identifying it with the cotangent bundle, and you can choose a way to identify functions on the cotangent bundle with differential operators, and then that algebra of differential operators can be naturally identified with the algebra we have constructed; in this way, the algebra acts on \"wave functions\" on your configuration space.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a linear space?
