Definition: A musical interval is two notes where the higher note vibrates at a set frequency rate faster than the lower one. An octave is an interval where the frequency rate is $2$ . Observation: If you compound an interval upon itself so that you have a base lower note, and a second note that vibrates at the set frequency more than a note the vaibrates at a set frequency above the low note, this new interval has a frequency that is the original frequency squared. That is to say if you have three notes: a base note $m$ a second note $n$ so that $m$ and $n$ is an interval of a frequency of $x$ , and third note $u$ so that $n$ and $u$ is an interval of a frequency of $x$ , then $m$ and $u$ is an interval of frequency $x^2$ . This should be clear as the vibration of $n$ is $x$ times the vibration of $m$ , and the vibration of $u$ is $x$ times the vibration of $n$ then the vibration of $u$ is $x$ times $x$ times the vibration of $m$ . That is $x^2$ times the vibration of $m$ . If you repeat the procedure a positive integer $k$ times, the resulting interval will be an interval with a frequency of the original frequency to the $k$ th power. Definition: An interval with a set frequency rate between $1$ and $2$ is said to split an octave if compounding the interval some positive integers of times creates an interval that is a positive integer of octaves. Claim: There is no interval with rational frequency that splits the octave. Pf: Suppose we have an interval with a frequency of $x; 1 , that when compounded $k$ times because an interval of $m$ octaves. That means $x^k = 2^m$ . If $x$ is rational then there exist integers $a, b$ so that $x =\\frac ab$ and $a$ and $b$ have now factors in common. So $(\\frac ab)^k = 2^m$ . So $\\frac {a^k}{b^k} = 2^m$ So $a^k = 2^m b^k$ . This means $2$ is a factor of $a^k$ and therefore, because $2$ is prime, $2$ must be a factor of $a$ . Any other prime factor, $p$ , of $a$ must be a prime factor of $2^mb^k$ but it can't be $2$ so it must be a prime factor of $b^k$ so it must be a factor of $b$ . But that's impossible as we assumed $a$ and $b$ had no factors in common. So $a$ has no other prime factors but $2$ . Meanwhile any prime factor of $b$ must be factor of $a^k$ and thus of $a$ . But we assumed $a$ and $b$ had not factors in common. So $b$ has no prime factors at all. ANd $a$ has only $2$ as a prime factor. So $b = 1$ and $a = 2^u$ for some positive integer $u$ . So that means $x = \\frac ab = \\frac {2^u}1 = 2^u$ . But then $x = 2^u \\ge 2$ . So the interval of $x$ is not less than an octave. In fact, $x$ must be $u$ octaves. So no interval \"splits an octave\". =========== old answer below ===== The major fifth vibrates and $\\frac 32$ . And a major fourth ant $\\frac 43$ . So a major fourth over a major fifth vibrates at $\\frac 32\\cdot \\frac 43=2$ and forms an octave.

That idea remains valid when you want to develop the group representation theory for spinors of the homogeneous Lorentz group in Minkowski space-time (with a few complications, among others due to the metric; Instead of three Pauli matrices you will now need four 4 x 4  gamma matrices. If you know the Dirac theory, you will recognize that this procedure is exactly the way Dirac obtained the gamma matrices. But he used the energy-momentum four-vector $(E,c{\\mathbf{p}})$ to define the basis rather than the four unit vectors ${\\mathbf{e}}_{\\mu}$ of space-time. It is all explained in detail in the reference above).  </p>\n\n<p>As there is a 1-1-correspondence between a set of basis vectors and the rotation that has produced it by operating on the canonical basis, you can thus visualize the spinor as a rotated basis. This remains true in Minkowski space time (now with a set of four basis vectors and with Lorentz transformations). In ${\\mathbb{R}}^{3}$ we have ${\\mathbf{e}}_{z} = \n{\\mathbf{e}}_{x} \\wedge {\\mathbf{e}}_{y}$, such that ${\\mathbf{e}}_{x}$ and ${\\mathbf{e}}_{y}$ are actually sufficient to reproduce the whole information.

That idea remains valid when you want to develop the group representation theory for spinors of the homogeneous Lorentz group in Minkowski space-time (with a few complications, among others due to the metric; Instead of three Pauli matrices you will now need four 4 x 4 gamma matrices. If you know the Dirac theory, you will recognize that this procedure is exactly the way Dirac obtained the gamma matrices. But he used the energy-momentum four-vector $(E,c{\\mathbf{p}})$ to define the basis rather than the four unit vectors ${\\mathbf{e}}_{\\mu}$ of space-time. It is all explained in detail in the reference above). As there is a 1-1-correspondence between a set of basis vectors and the rotation that has produced it by operating on the canonical basis, you can thus visualize the spinor as a rotated basis. This remains true in Minkowski space time (now with a set of four basis vectors and with Lorentz transformations). In ${\\mathbb{R}}^{3}$ we have ${\\mathbf{e}}_{z} = {\\mathbf{e}}_{x} \\wedge {\\mathbf{e}}_{y}$, such that ${\\mathbf{e}}_{x}$ and ${\\mathbf{e}}_{y}$ are actually sufficient to reproduce the whole information. You can therefore also represent the complete information by the isotropic vector ${\\mathbf{e}}_{x} +\\imath {\\mathbf{e}}_{y}$. After rotating ${\\mathbf{e}}_{x} +\\imath {\\mathbf{e}}_{y}$ you can just find ${\\mathbf{e}}'_{x}$ and ${\\mathbf{e}}'_{y}$ by taking the real and imaginary parts of the rotated isotropic vector ${\\mathbf{e}}'_{x} +\\imath {\\mathbf{e}}'_{y}$, and thus reconstruct the full rotated basis. This is the reason why one can also represent the rotations by using isotropic vectors. The rotated isotropic vectors are in 1-1-correspondence with the rotations. It is not any more difficult than that. It is simple geometry. There should not remain any secret or mystery that stands in your way to fully understand this. It is never well explained, which is probably due to the extremely concise way Cartan introduced them, without explaining what is going on behind the scenes. I hope this helps.
