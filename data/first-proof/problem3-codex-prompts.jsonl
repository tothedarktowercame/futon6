Assess completeness, correctness, and suggest improvements.\n\n## Proof\n\n# Problem 3: Markov Chain with Interpolation ASEP Polynomial Stationary Distribution\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nLet lambda = (lambda_1 > ... > lambda_n >= 0) be a restricted partition with\ndistinct parts (unique part of size 0, no part of size 1). Does there exist a\nnontrivial Markov chain on S_n(lambda) whose stationary distribution is\n\n    pi(mu) = F*_mu(x_1, ..., x_n; q=1, t) / P*_lambda(x_1, ..., x_n; q=1, t)\n\nwhere F*_mu are interpolation ASEP polynomials and P*_lambda is the\ninterpolation Macdonald polynomial?\n\n## Answer\n\nYes.\n\nTake the inhomogeneous multispecies t-PushTASEP on the finite ring of n sites\nwith content lambda and parameters x_1, ..., x_n. This is a concrete continuous-\ntime Markov chain defined directly from local species comparisons and ringing\nrates 1/x_i (no use of F*_mu in the transition rule). A theorem of\nAyyer-Martin-Williams identifies its stationary distribution as\n\n    pi(mu) = F_mu(x; 1, t) / P_lambda(x; 1, t),\n\nwhich is the ratio required in the problem statement (same q=1 ASEP/Macdonald\nfamily, up to notation conventions).\n\n## Confidence\n\nMedium-high. The existence claim is a direct consequence of a published theorem.\nThe nontriviality condition is checked from the explicit generator.\n\n## Solution\n\n### 1. State space\n\nLet\n\n    S_n(lambda) = {all permutations of the parts of lambda}.\n\nBecause lambda has distinct parts, |S_n(lambda)| = n!.\n\nThis is exactly the finite state space used by multispecies exclusion-type\ndynamics with one particle species per part value.\n\n### 2. Lemma (explicit chain construction)\n\nDefine a continuous-time Markov chain X_t on S_n(lambda) as follows.\n\nFix parameters x_1, ..., x_n > 0 and t in [0,1). At each site j, an exponential\nclock of rate 1/x_j rings.\n\nIf site j is a vacancy (species 0), nothing happens. If site j has species\nr_0 > 0, that particle becomes active. Let m be the number of particles in the\ncurrent configuration with species strictly less than r_0 (including vacancies).\nMoving clockwise, the active particle chooses the k-th weaker particle with\nprobability\n\n    t^(k-1) / [m]_t,   where [m]_t = 1 + t + ... + t^(m-1),\n\nand swaps into that position. If it displaced a nonzero species, the displaced\nparticle becomes active and repeats the same rule. The cascade ends when a\nvacancy is displaced.\n\nThis is the inhomogeneous multispecies t-PushTASEP.\n\nWhy this is a valid Markov chain:\n- The state space is finite.\n- The transition rule is explicit and depends only on current local ordering,\n  t, and x_i.\n- Rates are finite and nonnegative.\n\n### 3. Lemma (nontriviality)\n\nThe chain above is nontrivial in the sense asked by the problem:\n\n- Transition rates are defined from site rates 1/x_i, species inequalities, and\n  t-geometric choice weights.\n- No transition probability is defined using values of F*_mu or P*_lambda.\n\nSo this is not a Metropolis-style chain \"described using the target weights.\"\n\n### 4. Main theorem (stationary distribution)\n\nTheorem (Ayyer-Martin-Williams, 2024, Thm. 1.1):\nFor multispecies t-PushTASEP with content lambda and parameters x, the\nstationary probability of eta in S_n(lambda) is\n\n    pi(eta) = F_eta(x; 1, t) / P_lambda(x; 1, t),\n\nwhere F_eta are ASEP polynomials and P_lambda is the corresponding Macdonald\npolynomial (q=1 specialization).\n\nTherefore, the required ratio form exists as the stationary law of a concrete\nMarkov chain.\n\n### 5. Notation match to the prompt\n\nThe problem uses star notation F*_mu, P*_lambda for the q=1 interpolation/ASEP-\nMacdonald family. The theorem above uses F_mu, P_lambda notation for the same\nq=1 stationary-ratio family in this context.\n\nHence, under the paper-to-prompt notation match, we obtain exactly\n\n    pi(mu) = F*_mu / P*_lambda.\n\n(Any global normalization of the whole family cancels in the ratio.)\n\n### 6. Sanity check: n=2 reduction\n\nTake lambda=(a,0), state space {(a,0),(0,a)}. There is one non-vacancy and one\nvacancy. Bells ring at rates 1/x_1 and 1/x_2.\n\n- (a,0) -> (0,a) at rate 1/x_1\n- (0,a) -> (a,0) at rate 1/x_2\n\nSo the stationary distribution is\n\n    pi(a,0) = x_1/(x_1+x_2),   pi(0,a) = x_2/(x_1+x_2),\n\nwhich is consistent with the single-species stationary law in the same paper\n(Proposition 2.4, via recoloring reduction).\n\nThis confirms the construction is concrete and internally consistent in the\nsimplest nontrivial case.\n\n### 7. Conclusion\n\nA nontrivial chain exists: inhomogeneous multispecies t-PushTASEP on S_n(lambda).\nIts stationary law is exactly the ASEP/Macdonald q=1 ratio required by the\nproblem statement.
