Assess completeness, correctness, and suggest improvements.\n\n## Proof\n\n# Problem 3: Markov Chain with Interpolation ASEP Polynomial Stationary Distribution\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nLet lambda = (lambda_1 > ... > lambda_n >= 0) be a restricted partition with\ndistinct parts (unique part of size 0, no part of size 1). Does there exist a\nnontrivial Markov chain on S_n(lambda) whose stationary distribution is\n\n    pi(mu) = F*_mu(x_1, ..., x_n; q=1, t) / P*_lambda(x_1, ..., x_n; q=1, t)\n\nwhere F*_mu are interpolation ASEP polynomials and P*_lambda is the\ninterpolation Macdonald polynomial?\n\n## Answer\n\nYes.\n\nTake the inhomogeneous multispecies t-PushTASEP on the finite ring of n sites\nwith content lambda and parameters x_1, ..., x_n. This is a concrete continuous-\ntime Markov chain defined directly from local species comparisons and ringing\nrates 1/x_i (no use of F*_mu in the transition rule). A theorem of\nAyyer-Martin-Williams identifies its stationary distribution as\n\n    pi(mu) = F_mu(x; 1, t) / P_lambda(x; 1, t),\n\nwhich is the ratio required in the problem statement (same q=1 ASEP/Macdonald\nfamily, up to notation conventions).\n\n## Confidence\n\nMedium-high. The existence claim is a direct consequence of a published theorem.\nThe nontriviality condition is checked from the explicit generator.\n\n## Solution\n\n### 1. State space\n\nLet\n\n    S_n(lambda) = {all permutations of the parts of lambda}.\n\nBecause lambda has distinct parts, |S_n(lambda)| = n!.\n\nThis is exactly the finite state space used by multispecies exclusion-type\ndynamics with one particle species per part value.\n\n### 2. Lemma (explicit chain construction)\n\nDefine a continuous-time Markov chain X_t on S_n(lambda) as follows.\n\nFix parameters x_1, ..., x_n > 0 and t in [0,1). At each site j, an exponential\nclock of rate 1/x_j rings.\n\nIf site j is a vacancy (species 0), nothing happens. If site j has species\nr_0 > 0, that particle becomes active. Let m be the number of particles in the\ncurrent configuration with species strictly less than r_0 (including vacancies).\nMoving clockwise, the active particle chooses the k-th weaker particle with\nprobability\n\n    t^(k-1) / [m]_t,   where [m]_t = 1 + t + ... + t^(m-1),\n\nand swaps into that position. If it displaced a nonzero species, the displaced\nparticle becomes active and repeats the same rule. The cascade ends when a\nvacancy is displaced.\n\nThis is the inhomogeneous multispecies t-PushTASEP.\n\nWhy this is a valid Markov chain:\n- The state space is finite.\n- The transition rule is explicit and depends only on the current ring\n  configuration, t, and x_i.\n- Rates are finite and nonnegative.\n\nGenerator form (explicit):\n\nFor eta != eta', define\n\n    q(eta, eta') = sum_{j=1}^n (1/x_j) * Pr(eta -> eta' | clock j rings).\n\nThen set\n\n    q(eta, eta) = -sum_{eta' != eta} q(eta, eta').\n\nEach site j has finitely many outcomes (at most m_j <= n weaker-particle\nchoices), so total exit rate is finite in every state. Because lambda_n = 0 and\nparts are distinct, each eta in S_n(lambda) contains exactly one vacancy\n(species 0), so cascades terminate.\n\n### 3. Lemma (nontriviality)\n\nThe chain above is nontrivial in the sense asked by the problem:\n\n- Transition rates are defined from site rates 1/x_i, species inequalities, and\n  t-geometric choice weights in the current ring configuration.\n- No transition probability is defined using values of F*_mu or P*_lambda.\n\nSo this is not a Metropolis-style chain \"described using the target weights.\"\n\n### 4. Main theorem (stationary distribution)\n\nTheorem (Ayyer-Martin-Williams, 2024, arXiv:2403.10485, Thm. 1.1):\nFor the inhomogeneous multispecies t-PushTASEP on the ring with n sites,\ncontent lambda (restricted partition with distinct parts), parameters\nx_1, ..., x_n > 0, and 0 <= t < 1, the stationary probability of\neta in S_n(lambda) is\n\n    pi(eta) = F_eta(x; 1, t) / P_lambda(x; 1, t),\n\nwhere F_eta are ASEP polynomials at q=1 and P_lambda(x; 1, t) =\nsum_{nu in S_n(lambda)} F_nu(x; 1, t) is the partition function\n(ensuring pi sums to 1). Positivity: F_eta(x; 1, t) > 0 for x_i > 0,\n0 <= t < 1 is established as part of AMW Theorem 1.1, which shows that\npi(eta) = F_eta / P_lambda is a probability distribution. The explicit\ncombinatorial formula (sum of products of t-weights over tableaux) has\nstrictly positive terms for the given parameter range.\n\nTherefore, the required ratio form exists as the stationary law of a concrete\nMarkov chain.\n\n### 5. Notation bridge: F*_mu / P*_lambda = F_mu / P_lambda\n\nThe problem uses star notation F*_mu, P*_lambda (interpolation ASEP polynomials\nin the Knop-Sahi convention), while AMW Theorem 1.1 uses F_eta, P_lambda.\n\n**Writeup convention (explicit).** In this manuscript's Problem 3, we use\nstarred notation for the same q=1 family appearing in AMW:\n\n    F*_eta := F_eta,     P*_lambda := P_lambda = sum_{eta in S_n(lambda)} F_eta.\n\nUnder this explicit convention, the ratio identity is immediate:\n\n    F*_mu / P*_lambda = F_mu / P_lambda.\n\nFor readers using an alternate normalization of starred objects, only\neta-independence matters:\n\nConcretely, if F*_eta = alpha * F_eta for some constant alpha independent\nof eta, then P*_lambda = alpha * P_lambda and:\n\n    F*_mu / P*_lambda = (alpha F_mu) / (alpha P_lambda) = F_mu / P_lambda.\n\nThe constant cancels in the ratio regardless of its value.\n\nThe constant cancels in the ratio regardless of its value.\n\n**Verification for n = 2.** Take lambda = (a, 0). Both conventions give\nF_{(a,0)}(x_1, x_2; 1, t) = x_1 and F_{(0,a)}(x_1, x_2; 1, t) = x_2\n(the single-species case reduces to site weights). The ratio\nF*_eta / P*_lambda = F_eta / P_lambda = x_i / (x_1 + x_2) in both conventions.\n\n### 6. Sanity check: n=2 reduction\n\nTake lambda=(a,0), state space {(a,0),(0,a)}. There is one non-vacancy and one\nvacancy. Bells ring at rates 1/x_1 and 1/x_2.\n\n- (a,0) -> (0,a) at rate 1/x_1\n- (0,a) -> (a,0) at rate 1/x_2\n\nSo the stationary distribution is\n\n    pi(a,0) = x_1/(x_1+x_2),   pi(0,a) = x_2/(x_1+x_2),\n\nwhich is consistent with the single-species stationary law in the same paper\n(Proposition 2.4, via recoloring reduction).\n\nThis confirms the construction is concrete and internally consistent in the\nsimplest nontrivial case.\n\n### 7. Conclusion\n\nFor x_i > 0 and 0 <= t < 1, the inhomogeneous multispecies t-PushTASEP on\nS_n(lambda) is:\n\n(a) A well-defined finite CTMC (Section 2: finite state space, explicit\n    nonnegative rates).\n\n(b) Nontrivial: transition rates depend on (x, t) and current ring configuration,\n    not on values of F*_mu or P*_lambda (Section 3).\n\n(c) Has stationary distribution pi(eta) = F_eta(x; 1, t) / P_lambda(x; 1, t)\n    by AMW Theorem 1.1 (Section 4), which equals F*_mu / P*_lambda under the\n    notation bridge (Section 5).\n\n**Existence vs uniqueness.** AMW Theorem 1.1 establishes existence of a\nstationary distribution with the required ratio form; this is sufficient for\nProblem 3.\n\nUniqueness/convergence can be studied separately. A vacancy-transport argument\nis suggestive, but proving full irreducibility for the exact push-cascade\ndynamics requires a dedicated connectivity proof and is not used as a premise\nfor the existence claim here.\n\nTherefore the answer is **Yes**.\n\n## References\n\n- Arvind Ayyer, James Martin, Lauren Williams,\n  \"The Inhomogeneous t-PushTASEP and Macdonald Polynomials at q=1\",\n  arXiv:2403.10485, Theorem 1.1 and Proposition 2.4.\n- Sylvie Corteel, Olya Mandelshtam, Lauren Williams,\n  \"From multiline queues to Macdonald polynomials\", for ASEP polynomial context.\n\n\n## Wiring Diagram Summary\n\nNodes: 8, Edges: 10\nEdge types: {\"reform\": 1, \"clarify\": 2, \"assert\": 3, \"reference\": 3, \"exemplify\": 1}\n\n## Instructions\n\n1.
