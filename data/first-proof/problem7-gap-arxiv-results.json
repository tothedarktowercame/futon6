New features include an explicit description of homotopy groups using the Maurer-Cartan equations, convergent spectral sequences comparing schematic homotopy groups with cohomology of the universal semisimple local system, and a generalisation of the Baues-Lemaire conjecture. For compact Kaehler manifolds, the schematic homotopy groups can be described explicitly in terms of this cohomology ring, giving canonical weight decompositions. There are also notions of minimal models, unpointed homotopy types and algebraic automorphism groups. For a space with algebraically good fundamental group and higher homotopy groups of finite rank, the schematic homotopy groups are shown to be \u03c0_n(X)\\otimes k.",

We prove the existence of a model category structure on the category of small closed tensor dg-categories and as a most simple case, confirm an equivalence between the homotopy category of spaces whose fundamental groups are finite and whose higher homotopy groups are finite dimensional rational vector spaces and the homotopy category of small closed tensor dg-categories satisfying certain conditions.",

In the simply-connected setting, a space is formal if its rational homotopy type is determined by the rational cohomology ring. In the general setting, the weaker 1-formality property allows one to reconstruct the rational pro-unipotent completion of the fundamental group, solely from the cup products of degree 1 cohomology classes. In this note, we survey various facets of formality, with emphasis on the geometric and algebraic implications of 1-formality, and its relations to the cohomology jump loci and the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariant. We also produce examples of 4-manifolds W such that, for every compact K\u00e4hler manifold M, the product M\\times W has the rational homotopy type of a K\u00e4hler manifold, yet M\\times W admits no K\u00e4hler metric.",

We study the derived moduli space of G-local systems on a pointed connected CW complex X trivialized at the basepoint of $X$. This derived moduli space is represented by an affine DG scheme RLoc$_G(X,*)$: we call the (co)homology of the structure sheaf of RLoc$_G(X,*)$ the representation homology of $X$ in $G$ and denote it by HR$_*(X,G)$. The HR$_0(X,G)$ is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of the representation variety Rep$_G[\u03c0_1(X)]$ of the fundamental group of $X$ in $G$ -- a well-known algebro-geometric invariant of $X$ with many applications in topology. The case when X is simply connected seems much less studied: in this case, the HR$_0(X,G)$ is trivial but the higher representation homology is still an interesting rational invariant of $X$ depending on the algebraic group $G$. In this paper, we use rational homotopy theory to compute the HR$_*(X,G)$ for an arbitrary simply connected space $X$ (of finite rational type) in terms of its Quillen and Sullivan algebraic models. When $G$ is reductive, we also compute the $G$-invariant part of representation homology, HR$_*(X,G)^G$, and study the question when HR$_*(X,G)^G$ is free of locally finite type as a graded commutative algebra. This question turns out to be closely related to the so-called Strong Macdonald Conjecture, a celebrated result in representation theory proposed (as a conjecture) by B. Feigin and P. Hanlon in the 1980s and proved by S. Fishel, I. Grojnowski and C. Teleman in 2008. Reformulating the Strong Macdonald Conjecture in topological terms, we give a simple characterization of spaces $X$ for which HR$_*(X,G)^G$ is a graded symmetric algebra for any complex reductive group $G$.",

New features include an explicit description of homotopy groups using the Maurer-Cartan equations, convergent spectral sequences comparing schematic homotopy groups with cohomology of the universal semisimple local system, and a generalisation of the Baues-Lemaire conjecture. For compact Kaehler manifolds, the schematic homotopy groups can be described explicitly in terms of this cohomology ring, giving canonical weight decompositions. There are also notions of minimal models, unpointed homotopy types and algebraic automorphism groups. For a space with algebraically good fundamental group and higher homotopy groups of finite rank, the schematic homotopy groups are shown to be \u03c0_n(X)\\otimes k.",

In the general setting, the weaker 1-formality property allows one to reconstruct the rational pro-unipotent completion of the fundamental group, solely from the cup products of degree 1 cohomology classes. In this note, we survey various facets of formality, with emphasis on the geometric and algebraic implications of 1-formality, and its relations to the cohomology jump loci and the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariant.

We study the derived moduli space of G-local systems on a pointed connected CW complex X trivialized at the basepoint of $X$. This derived moduli space is represented by an affine DG scheme RLoc$_G(X,*)$: we call the (co)homology of the structure sheaf of RLoc$_G(X,*)$ the representation homology of $X$ in $G$ and denote it by HR$_*(X,G)$. The HR$_0(X,G)$ is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of the representation variety Rep$_G[\u03c0_1(X)]$ of the fundamental group of $X$ in $G$ -- a well-known algebro-geometric invariant of $X$ with many applications in topology. The case when X is simply connected seems much less studied: in this case, the HR$_0(X,G)$ is trivial but the higher representation homology is still an interesting rational invariant of $X$ depending on the algebraic group $G$. In this paper, we use rational homotopy theory to compute the HR$_*(X,G)$ for an arbitrary simply connected space $X$ (of finite rational type) in terms of its Quillen and Sullivan algebraic models. When $G$ is reductive, we also compute the $G$-invariant part of representation homology, HR$_*(X,G)^G$, and study the question when HR$_*(X,G)^G$ is free of locally finite type as a graded commutative algebra. This question turns out to be closely related to the so-called Strong Macdonald Conjecture, a celebrated result in representation theory proposed (as a conjecture) by B. Feigin and P. Hanlon in the 1980s and proved by S. Fishel, I. Grojnowski and C. Teleman in 2008. Reformulating the Strong Macdonald Conjecture in topological terms, we give a simple characterization of spaces $X$ for which HR$_*(X,G)^G$ is a graded symmetric algebra for any complex reductive group $G$.",
