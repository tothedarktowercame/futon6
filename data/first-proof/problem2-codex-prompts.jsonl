The nondegeneracy claim is natural but the \"nonzero for all s\"\ncondition requires a careful algebraic argument about fractional ideals.\n\n## Solution\n\n### 1. Rankin-Selberg theory background\n\nThe local Rankin-Selberg integral I(s, W, V) for GL_{n+1} x GL_n is:\n\n    I(s, W, V) = int_{N_n\\GL_n(F)} W(diag(g,1)) V(g) |det g|^{s-1/2} dg\n\nThis converges for Re(s) >> 0 and extends to a rational function of q_F^{-s}\n(where q_F = |o/p|). The set of all such integrals as (W, V) vary generates\na fractional ideal of C[q_F^s, q_F^{-s}], whose generator is the local\nL-factor L(s, Pi x pi).\n\nThe problem modifies this by inserting u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1} into the\nargument of W, giving the \"twisted\" Rankin-Selberg integral.\n\n### 2. The condition \"finite and nonzero for all s\"\n\nFor a rational function f(q_F^{-s}) to be \"finite and nonzero for all s in C,\"\nit must have no poles and no zeros when viewed as a function of\nX = q_F^{-s} in C^x. Such a rational function must be c * X^k = c * q_F^{-ks}\nfor some nonzero c and integer k.\n\nSo the condition requires: there exists V such that I(s, W, V) = c * q_F^{-ks}\nfor some nonzero constant c and integer k.\n\nSince the integrals over V span L(s, Pi x pi) * C[q_F^s, q_F^{-s}] (for\nfixed W, assuming nondegeneracy), this means we need to find V such that the\npolynomial factor P(q_F^{-s}) satisfies P * L = c * q_F^{-ks}. Since\nL(s, Pi x pi)^{-1} is a polynomial in q_F^{-s}, we need P to equal\nc * q_F^{-ks} * L^{-1}, which is indeed a Laurent polynomial.\n\nThis is possible provided the integrals over V (for our fixed W) span the\nfull fractional ideal, i.e., the Rankin-Selberg pairing is nondegenerate\nfor our chosen W.\n\n### 3. The u_Q twist and the Kirillov model\n\nThe key role of u_Q: right-translating W by u_Q gives a new Whittaker function\nR(u_Q)W in W(Pi, psi^{-1}). The restriction to the mirabolic subgroup\nP_{n+1} gives the Kirillov model, and the function:\n\n    phi_Q(g) := W(diag(g,1) u_Q) = (R(u_Q)W)(diag(g,1))\n\nlies in the Kirillov model of Pi restricted to GL_n.\n\nSince Pi is generic and W is nonzero, R(u_Q)W is nonzero for all Q (right\ntranslation by a unipotent element preserves the Whittaker model and maps\nnonzero vectors to nonzero vectors). Therefore phi_Q is a nonzero function\nin the Kirillov model for every Q.\n\n### 4. Nondegeneracy of the pairing\n\nFor a nonzero phi_Q in the Kirillov model, the Rankin-Selberg pairing:\n\n    V |-> int_{N_n\\GL_n(F)} phi_Q(g) V(g) |det g|^{s-1/2} dg\n\nis nondegenerate as V ranges over W(pi, psi). This is the fundamental\nnondegeneracy of the Rankin-Selberg integral (Jacquet-Piatetski-Shapiro-\nShalika 1983, Section 2.7).\n\nMore precisely: since phi_Q is nonzero, the integrals over all V in W(pi, psi)\ngenerate the full fractional ideal L(s, Pi x pi) * C[q_F^s, q_F^{-s}].\n\n### 5. Choosing W: the new vector\n\n**Choice:** Let W_0 be the new vector (essential Whittaker function) of Pi,\ni.e., the vector in W(Pi, psi^{-1}) fixed by the congruence subgroup\nK_1(p^{c(Pi)}) where c(Pi) is the conductor exponent of Pi.\n\n**Properties of W_0:**\n- W_0 is nonzero (Pi is generic)\n- W_0(I_{n+1}) = 1 (standard normalization)\n- R(u_Q)W_0 is nonzero for every Q in F^x (as argued in Step 3)\n\n**Universality:** For any generic pi of GL_n(F) with conductor ideal q:\n- Let Q generate q^{-1}\n- The function phi_Q(g) = W_0(diag(g,1) u_Q) is nonzero in the Kirillov model\n- By the nondegeneracy (Step 4), there exists V in W(pi, psi) such that\n  I(s, W_0, V) is a nonzero element of L(s, Pi x pi) * C[q_F^s, q_F^{-s}]\n- By the algebraic argument (Step 2), V can be chosen to make the integral\n  equal to c * q_F^{-ks}, which is finite and nonzero for all s\n\n### 6. The role of u_Q in conductor matching\n\nThe insertion of u_Q = I + Q E_{n,n+1} is essential: it compensates for the\nconductor of pi. Without this twist, for highly ramified pi, the integral\nmight degenerate (the new vector of Pi would not \"see\" the ramification of pi).\n\nThe matrix u_Q acts on the (n, n+1)-entry, effectively shifting by Q in\nthe direction of the last standard basis vector. Since Q = pi_F^{-c(pi)}\n(where pi_F is a uniformizer), this shift has size exactly matching the\nconductor of pi. This ensures the twisted Whittaker function\nW_0(diag(g,1) u_Q) interacts nontrivially with the Kirillov model of pi\nat the right \"scale.\"\n\nConcretely: in the Iwasawa decomposition g = nak, the twist by u_Q\nmodifies the a-component (diagonal part) at scale Q, ensuring the support\nof g |-> W_0(diag(g,1) u_Q) overlaps with the support of the new vector\nof pi (which is concentrated at conductor scale c(pi)).\n\n### 7. Verification in special cases\n\n**Both unramified (c(Pi) = c(pi) = 0):** u_Q = I + E_{n,n+1} (Q = 1).\nW_0 is the spherical vector. The integral with V_0 (spherical for pi)\ngives L(s, Pi x pi) * (correction factor). Choose V to cancel the L-factor.\n\n**Pi unramified, pi ramified:** u_Q has Q = pi_F^{-c(pi)}. The twist\nshifts the support of the spherical vector to match the ramification of pi.\nThis is the classical \"conductor-lowering\" mechanism.\n\n**Both ramified:** The new vector of Pi combined with the u_Q twist gives a\nfunction in the Kirillov model whose support is compatible with the\nconductor of pi. Nondegeneracy follows from the general JPSS theory.\n\n### 8. Summary\n\n1. The answer is YES: the new vector W_0 of Pi is a universal test vector\n2. For any pi with conductor q, the twist u_Q (Q generates q^{-1}) ensures\n   the Rankin-Selberg pairing is nondegenerate\n3. Nondegeneracy of the Kirillov restriction: R(u_Q)W_0 is always nonzero\n4. The fractional ideal structure of Rankin-Selberg integrals allows\n   choosing V to make the integral a monomial c * q_F^{-ks}\n5. This monomial is finite and nonzero for all s in C\n\n## Key References from futon6 corpus\n\n- PlanetMath: \"representation theory\" -- admissible representations\n- PlanetMath: \"L-function\" -- L-factors and analytic properties\n- PlanetMath: \"locally compact group\" -- p-adic groups\n\n\n## Wiring Diagram Summary\n\nNodes: 8, Edges: 11\nEdge types: {\"clarify\": 3, \"reform\": 1, \"assert\": 3, \"reference\": 4}\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Is the proof complete? Does the answer follow from the stated steps?\n2. Are there unstated assumptions (e.g., about the residual characteristic of F, the genericity of Pi, whether psi has conductor exactly o, whether Pi is supercuspidal/discrete-series/generic-principal-series)?\n3. The nondegeneracy claim (Section 4) is the crux: does JPSS 1983 Section 2.7 actually give nondegeneracy for FIXED phi_Q varying V, or does it require varying both? If the latter, the proof has a gap.\n4. The conductor matching argument (Section 6) is heuristic: is the Iwasawa decomposition reasoning rigorous, or does it need a more careful analysis of support conditions in the Kirillov model?\n5.
