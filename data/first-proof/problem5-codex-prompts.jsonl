{"node_id": "proof-synthesis", "node_type": "synthesis", "prompt": "You are a mathematical proof verifier reviewing a complete proof.\n\n## Task\n\nVerify one step of the supplied proof. Assess completeness, correctness, and suggest improvements.\n\n## Proof\n\n# Problem 5: O-Slice Connectivity via Geometric Fixed Points\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nFix a finite group `G`. Let `O` denote an incomplete transfer system\nassociated to an `N_infinity` operad. Define a slice filtration on `SH^G`\nadapted to `O` and characterize `O`-slice connectivity of a connective\n`G`-spectrum using geometric fixed points.\n\n## Short Answer\n\nUse the classical regular-slice cells, but restrict subgroup indexing to the\nsubgroups allowed by the transfer system. Under that definition, the\nconnectivity test is exactly the same geometric-fixed-point test, but only for\nthose allowed subgroups.\n\n## Confidence\n\nMedium. The corrected formulation is structurally consistent with known slice\nand geometric-fixed-point machinery, and avoids the nonstandard\n`rho_H^O` definition from the previous draft.\n\n## Important Correction\n\nThe previous draft used an `O`-regular representation `rho_H^O`. That is not\nstandard in the transfer-system / `N_infinity` literature. Transfer/indexing\nsystems control admissible transfers (and admissible finite `H`-sets), not a\nreplacement for the regular representation in slice-cell definitions.\n\n## Working Definition (transfer-restricted regular slice)\n\nLet `T_O` be the transfer system. Define the admissible subgroup family\n\n    F_O = { H <= G : the transfer e -> H is allowed in T_O }.\n\nDefine `tau_{>= n}^O` as the localizing subcategory generated by regular slice\ncells\n\n    G_+ wedge_H S^{k rho_H}\n\nwith `H in F_O` and `k|H| >= n`.\n\nThis is the same generating template as regular slice filtration, with subgroup\nindexing restricted by `O`.\n\nReference anchor:\n- Regular slice generators are the `G_+ ∧_H S^{k rho_H}` pattern\n  (Hill-Yarnall, Definition 1.1 in arXiv:1703.10526).\n\n## Characterization Theorem (for this definition)\n\nLet `X` be connective. Then\n\n    X in tau_{>= n}^O\n\niff for every `H in F_O`,\n\n    Phi^H X is (ceil(n/|H|) - 1)-connected.\n\nEquivalent homotopy-group form:\n\n    pi_i(Phi^H X) = 0  for all i < ceil(n/|H|), for all H in F_O.\n\nReference anchor:\n- The geometric-fixed-point characterization for regular slice connectivity is\n  given in Hill-Yarnall as Theorem A (introduction) and Theorem 2.5\n  (arXiv:1703.10526).\n\n## Proof Sketch\n\n1. By construction of `tau_{>= n}^O`, membership is tested against maps out of\n   generating cells with `k|H| < n`.\n2. For each `H`, geometric fixed points of a regular slice cell satisfy\n   `Phi^H(G_+ wedge_H S^{k rho_H}) ~= S^k`.\n3. Therefore maps from those generators detect `pi_k(Phi^H X)`.\n4. Vanishing for all generators with `k|H| < n` is exactly vanishing of\n   `pi_i(Phi^H X)` for `i < ceil(n/|H|)`, for each allowed `H`.\n\nSo the geometric-fixed-point criterion is unchanged in shape; only the set of\nsubgroups checked is restricted by `O`.\n\nInterpretation note:\n- The proof is a restriction-of-indexing argument on top of the regular-slice\n  characterization; it does not introduce new point-set machinery beyond the\n  standard geometric-fixed-point computation on regular slice cells.\n\n## Special Cases\n\n1. Complete transfer system (`F_O = all subgroups`): recovers the usual regular\n   slice criterion.\n2. Trivial transfer system (`F_O = {e}`): criterion reduces to ordinary\n   Postnikov connectivity of the underlying spectrum.\n3. Intermediate transfer systems: interpolate by checking connectivity only on\n   the allowed subgroup family.\n\n## Scope / Caveat\n\nThis is a clean, internally consistent adaptation aligned with transfer-system\ndata. Full literature-grade incomplete-slice constructions are often phrased\nusing admissible finite `H`-sets and indexing systems; this note is the\nsubgroup-indexed version needed for the current Problem 5 pipeline.\n\nLiterature positioning:\n- `N_infinity` operads and admissibility data: Blumberg-Hill, Definition 1.1.\n- Their first classification-level structural result is Theorem 1.2\n  (fully-faithful embedding of the homotopy category of `N_infinity` operads\n  into indexing-system data), arXiv:1309.1750.\n- So transfer/indexing systems are the source of \"which subgroup data is\n  allowed\"; they do not provide a standard replacement regular representation.\n\n## References\n\n- Michael A.
