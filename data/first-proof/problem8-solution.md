# Problem 8: Lagrangian Smoothing of Polyhedral Surfaces with 4-Valent Vertices

## Problem Statement

A **polyhedral Lagrangian surface** K in R^4 is a finite polyhedral complex all
of whose faces are Lagrangian 2-planes, which is a topological submanifold of
R^4. A **Lagrangian smoothing** of K is a Hamiltonian isotopy K_t of smooth
Lagrangian submanifolds for t in (0,1], extending to a topological isotopy on
[0,1], with K_0 = K.

**Question:** If K has exactly 4 faces meeting at every vertex, does K
necessarily have a Lagrangian smoothing?

## Answer

**Yes.** A polyhedral Lagrangian surface with 4 faces per vertex always admits
a Lagrangian smoothing.

**Confidence: Medium.** The argument relies on Lagrangian surgery theory and a
Maslov index computation that should be verified.

## Solution

### 1. Setup: Lagrangian planes in R^4

Identify R^4 = C^2 with symplectic form omega = dx_1 ∧ dy_1 + dx_2 ∧ dy_2.
A Lagrangian plane is a 2-dimensional subspace L where omega|_L = 0. The space
of Lagrangian planes (the Lagrangian Grassmannian) is:

    Lambda(2) = U(2)/O(2)

This is a manifold of dimension 3 with pi_1(Lambda(2)) = Z (the Maslov class).

Each face of K lies in a Lagrangian plane. At each edge, two Lagrangian faces
meet at a dihedral angle. At each vertex, 4 Lagrangian faces meet.

### 2. Local structure at a 4-valent vertex

At a vertex v, the 4 faces L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4 (in cyclic order around v) are
Lagrangian half-planes meeting along edges:

    e_{12} = L_1 ∩ L_2,  e_{23} = L_2 ∩ L_3,  e_{34} = L_3 ∩ L_4,  e_{41} = L_4 ∩ L_1

These 4 edges are rays from v. Each L_i = span{e_{i-1,i}, e_{i,i+1}} is a
Lagrangian 2-plane.

**Key observation (pairing into crossing sheets):** The 4 faces pair naturally
into two "sheets":

    Sheet A = L_1 ∪ L_3  (opposite faces)
    Sheet B = L_2 ∪ L_4  (opposite faces)

Each sheet is a piecewise-Lagrangian surface with a crease (a bend along a line
through v). The two sheets cross transversally at v, forming a **Lagrangian
crossing** — a transverse double point of two Lagrangian disks.

### 3. Maslov index of the vertex loop

The cyclic sequence L_1 → L_2 → L_3 → L_4 → L_1 defines a loop in Lambda(2).
Its Maslov index mu is the winding number of det^2(e^{i theta}) as the
Lagrangian plane rotates through the 4 positions.

**Claim:** The Maslov index of the vertex loop is 0 (mod 4).

**Argument:** Each transition L_i → L_{i+1} contributes a Maslov increment
mu_i in {0, ±1}. The 4-face condition with the topological submanifold
requirement (local flatness at v) constrains the L_i to have alternating
orientations relative to J (the standard complex structure on C^2). This gives:

    mu = mu_1 + mu_2 + mu_3 + mu_4 = 0

Specifically, the Maslov index of a transverse Lagrangian crossing (two
Lagrangian planes meeting transversally) is 0. The paired-sheet decomposition
(Sheet A crossing Sheet B) inherits this vanishing Maslov index.

### 4. Lagrangian surgery at transverse double points

**Classical result (Polterovich 1991, Lalonde-Sikorav 1991):** Let L_1, L_2
be two Lagrangian disks in (R^4, omega) meeting transversally at a single
point p. There exists a Lagrangian surgery that replaces a neighborhood of p
with a smooth Lagrangian annulus, producing a smooth Lagrangian surface.

The surgery is performed by:
1. Choosing Darboux coordinates (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) centered at p with
   L_1 = {y_1 = y_2 = 0} and L_2 = {x_1 = y_2 - x_2 = 0} (or similar
   transverse configuration)
2. Replacing the crossing with a smooth Lagrangian "neck" connecting the
   two sheets
3. The neck is parameterized by a generating function S(x) with
   y = grad S(x), ensuring omega|_{graph} = 0

The resulting smooth Lagrangian is Hamiltonian isotopic to the original
singular union (the isotopy parameter t controls the neck width, with
t -> 0 giving the singular crossing).

### 5. Application to 4-valent polyhedral Lagrangians

**Step 5a: Resolve vertices.** At each 4-valent vertex v, the paired-sheet
decomposition gives a transverse Lagrangian crossing. Apply Lagrangian surgery
to resolve the crossing, producing a smooth Lagrangian in a neighborhood of v.

**Step 5b: Smooth edges.** After vertex resolution, the remaining singularities
are the edges (creases between adjacent faces). Each edge is a curve along
which two Lagrangian planes meet at a dihedral angle. These creases are
resolved by a Lagrangian smoothing of the crease — a standard procedure using
the generating function technique:

If the two faces near an edge are y = grad S_1(x) and y = grad S_2(x) in
Darboux coordinates, the smoothing interpolates: y = grad S_t(x) where
S_t smoothly transitions from S_1 to S_2.

**Step 5c: Hamiltonian isotopy.** The combined vertex resolutions and edge
smoothings are all achieved via Hamiltonian isotopies (each is generated by a
compactly supported Hamiltonian function). The composition of these Hamiltonian
isotopies gives the global smoothing K_t.

The 4-face condition is essential:
- With 4 faces per vertex, the paired-sheet decomposition gives a TRANSVERSE
  Lagrangian crossing (codimension 0 intersection of two 2-dimensional sheets
  in R^4), which is resolvable by surgery
- With 3 or 5 faces per vertex, the pairing into two sheets fails, and the
  vertex singularity may have nonzero Maslov index, obstructing resolution

### 6. Topological constraints

For the polyhedral K to be a compact topological submanifold with 4 faces per
vertex, Euler's formula constrains the topology. If all faces are
quadrilaterals: V - E + F = chi(K), with 4F = 2E and 4V = 2E, giving chi = 0.
So K is topologically a torus or Klein bottle.

For non-quadrilateral faces (triangles, pentagons, etc.) with 4 per vertex,
other topologies are possible but chi <= 0 (higher genus surfaces).

In all cases, the Lagrangian condition omega|_K = 0 (each face Lagrangian)
combined with vanishing Maslov index at vertices ensures the smoothing exists.

### 7. Summary

The smoothing exists because:
1. The 4-face condition gives a pairing into two transversely crossing sheets
2. Transverse Lagrangian crossings have Maslov index 0
3. Zero Maslov index allows Lagrangian surgery (Polterovich, Lalonde-Sikorav)
4. Edge creases are smoothed by generating function interpolation
5. All smoothings are Hamiltonian isotopies, composable to give the global K_t
