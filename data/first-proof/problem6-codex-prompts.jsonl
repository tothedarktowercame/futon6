{"node":"p6-rayleigh","prompt":"Verify: For an edge e={u,v} internal to a vertex subset I_0 of a connected graph G, the effective resistance satisfies R_eff^G(e) ≤ R_eff^{G[I_0]}(e), where G[I_0] is the induced subgraph. This follows from Rayleigh's monotonicity principle: adding edges (those in G but not in G[I_0]) can only decrease effective resistance. Consequence: Σ_{e internal to I_0} τ_e ≤ |I_0|-1 where τ_e = w_e·R_eff^G(e), using Foster's theorem on the induced subgraph. Is this argument correct? Any subtlety with weighted graphs or disconnected induced subgraphs?"}
{"node":"p6-partial-avg","prompt":"Verify Theorem 4.2: Let I_0 be a set of m vertices with leverage degrees ℓ_v = Σ_{u∈I_0,u~v} τ_{uv}, where avg ℓ < 2 (from Foster on induced subgraph). A 'min-ℓ greedy' selects T = ⌊εm/3⌋ vertices in order of increasing ℓ. At M_t = 0 (no accumulated barrier): d̄_t = (1/(εr_t))·Σ_{u∈S_t} ℓ_u^R where ℓ_u^R ≤ ℓ_u. By partial averages: Σ_{k=1}^T ℓ_{(k)} ≤ T·avg(ℓ) < 2T(m-1)/m. With r_t ≥ m(1-ε/3): d̄ < (2/3)/(1-ε/3) < 1 for ε∈(0,1). Check each step. Is the bound tight? Does it approach 1 as ε→1?"}
{"node":"p6-kn-exact","prompt":"For the complete graph K_n with unit weights: τ_e = 2/n, ℓ_v = 2(n-1)/n. The barrier greedy at step t has d̄_t = 2t/(nε) at M_t=0. With M_t≠0 (K_n has all pairs connected), the claimed exact formula is d̄(K_k,t) = (t-1)/(kε-t) + (t+1)/(kε). Derive this formula from the K_n Laplacian structure. Show it approaches 5/6 as k→∞ with t=εk/3. What is the structure of M_t for K_n — is it proportional to the induced Laplacian on S_t?"}
{"node":"p6-amplification","prompt":"The main open sub-gap: at M_t≠0, the barrier matrix H_t = εI - M_t amplifies traces via tr(H_t^{-1}C_t(v)) ≥ tr(C_t(v))/ε. The crude bound gives amplification ε/(ε-||M_t||), but this is too loose. Empirically, max amplification ≤1.30 across all tested graphs. Consider five approaches to close this gap: (A) Tighter trace inequality exploiting directional mismatch between M_t and the cross-edge matrix A_t; (B) BSS-style potential function tr(H_t^{-1}) or log det(H_t); (C) Reduced horizon T=εm/4 with provable amplification bound; (D) Random sampling + matrix concentration (Tropp) bypassing greedy entirely; (E) Foster-like identity on rescaled leverage scores τ̃_e = tr(H_t^{-1}X_e). Which approach is most promising? Can you close the gap?"}
{"node":"p6-epsilon-sq","prompt":"The proof gives |S| ≥ ε²n/9 (from |I_0| ≥ εn/3, greedy runs εm/3 steps). Problem 6 asks for |S| ≥ cεn. For fixed ε, c=ε/9 works. But can we avoid the ε² dependence? Possible routes: (1) Can Turán be improved if heavy edges have structure? (2) Can the greedy run for more than εm/3 steps? (3) Random sampling gives |S|~εm/3 in expectation without the second ε factor — can this be formalized? What is the best achievable c as a function of ε?"}
{"node":"p6-synthesis","prompt":"Review the complete proof in problem6-proof-draft.md. The proof establishes: (1) Reformulation via normalized edge matrices X_e, (2) Heavy/light + Turán → I_0 with |I_0|≥εn/3, (3) Foster on I_0 → avg leverage degree < 2, (4) Partial averages + min-ℓ greedy → d̄ < 1 at M_t=0, (5) PSD trace + pigeonhole → barrier greedy succeeds. One gap: d̄ < 1 at M_t≠0. Give an overall assessment: (a) Is the proof correct modulo the stated gap? (b) Is the gap closeable? (c) What is the overall quality and novelty — the 'pigeonhole replaces interlacing families' claim is bold, is it justified? (d) Any errors, missing cases, or hidden assumptions?"}
