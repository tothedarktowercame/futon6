# Problem 5: O-Slice Connectivity via Geometric Fixed Points

## Problem Statement

Fix a finite group `G`. Let `O` denote an incomplete transfer system
associated to an `N_infinity` operad. Define a slice filtration on `SH^G`
adapted to `O` and characterize `O`-slice connectivity of a connective
`G`-spectrum using geometric fixed points.

## Short Answer

Use the classical regular-slice cells, but restrict subgroup indexing to the
subgroups allowed by the transfer system. Under that definition, the
connectivity test is exactly the same geometric-fixed-point test, but only for
those allowed subgroups.

## Confidence

Medium. The corrected formulation is structurally consistent with known slice
and geometric-fixed-point machinery, and avoids the nonstandard
`rho_H^O` definition from the previous draft.

## Important Correction

The previous draft used an `O`-regular representation `rho_H^O`. That is not
standard in the transfer-system / `N_infinity` literature. Transfer/indexing
systems control admissible transfers (and admissible finite `H`-sets), not a
replacement for the regular representation in slice-cell definitions.

## Working Definition (transfer-restricted regular slice)

Let `T_O` be the transfer system. Define the admissible subgroup family

    F_O = { H <= G : the transfer e -> H is allowed in T_O }.

Define `tau_{>= n}^O` as the localizing subcategory generated by regular slice
cells

    G_+ wedge_H S^{k rho_H}

with `H in F_O` and `k|H| >= n`.

This is the same generating template as regular slice filtration, with subgroup
indexing restricted by `O`.

Reference anchor:
- Regular slice generators are the `G_+ ∧_H S^{k rho_H}` pattern
  (Hill-Yarnall, Definition 1.1 in arXiv:1703.10526).

## Characterization Theorem (for this definition)

Let `X` be connective. Then

    X in tau_{>= n}^O

iff for every `H in F_O`,

    Phi^H X is (ceil(n/|H|) - 1)-connected.

Equivalent homotopy-group form:

    pi_i(Phi^H X) = 0  for all i < ceil(n/|H|), for all H in F_O.

Reference anchor:
- The geometric-fixed-point characterization for regular slice connectivity is
  given in Hill-Yarnall as Theorem A (introduction) and Theorem 2.5
  (arXiv:1703.10526).

## Proof Sketch

1. By construction of `tau_{>= n}^O`, membership is tested against maps out of
   generating cells with `k|H| < n`.
2. For each `H`, geometric fixed points of a regular slice cell satisfy
   `Phi^H(G_+ wedge_H S^{k rho_H}) ~= S^k`.
3. Therefore maps from those generators detect `pi_k(Phi^H X)`.
4. Vanishing for all generators with `k|H| < n` is exactly vanishing of
   `pi_i(Phi^H X)` for `i < ceil(n/|H|)`, for each allowed `H`.

So the geometric-fixed-point criterion is unchanged in shape; only the set of
subgroups checked is restricted by `O`.

Interpretation note:
- The proof is a restriction-of-indexing argument on top of the regular-slice
  characterization; it does not introduce new point-set machinery beyond the
  standard geometric-fixed-point computation on regular slice cells.

## Special Cases

1. Complete transfer system (`F_O = all subgroups`): recovers the usual regular
   slice criterion.
2. Trivial transfer system (`F_O = {e}`): criterion reduces to ordinary
   Postnikov connectivity of the underlying spectrum.
3. Intermediate transfer systems: interpolate by checking connectivity only on
   the allowed subgroup family.

## Scope / Caveat

This is a clean, internally consistent adaptation aligned with transfer-system
data. Full literature-grade incomplete-slice constructions are often phrased
using admissible finite `H`-sets and indexing systems; this note is the
subgroup-indexed version needed for the current Problem 5 pipeline.

Literature positioning:
- `N_infinity` operads and admissibility data: Blumberg-Hill, Definition 1.1.
- Their first classification-level structural result is Theorem 1.2
  (fully-faithful embedding of the homotopy category of `N_infinity` operads
  into indexing-system data), arXiv:1309.1750.
- So transfer/indexing systems are the source of "which subgroup data is
  allowed"; they do not provide a standard replacement regular representation.
