Using a recently developed ordinary equivariant homology and cohomology, we define equivariant Poincare complexes with the properties that (1) every compact G-manifold is an equivariant Poincare complex, (2) every finite equivariant Poincare complex (with some mild additional hypotheses) has an equivariant spherical Spivak normal fibration, and (3) the Pi-Pi Theorem holds for equivariant Poincare pairs under suitable gap hypotheses. The nice behavior of the ordinary equivariant homology and cohomology theories allows us to follow Wall's original line of argument closely.",

This provides a concrete geometric model for equivariant cohomotopy which works for any compact Lie group G. In the special case when G is finite or a torus, we show that our construction recovers the construction of Wasserman, providing a new perspective on equivariant bordism. We connect the results with bordisms of global quotient orbifolds, utilizing the machinery of Gepner-Henriques to describe bordisms of framed orbifolds in terms of equivariant cohomotopy. We also illustrate the utility of the theory by applying our results to M-theory, thus connecting with recent work of Huerta, Sati and Schreiber.",

Unlike previous approaches, we do not utilize any closed 4-manifold topology or contact topology. Instead, we adapt the formalism of local equivalence coming from involutive Heegaard Floer homology. As an application, we define a modification $\u0398^\u03c4_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ of the homology cobordism group which takes into account an involution on each homology sphere, and prove that this admits a $\\mathbb{Z}^\\infty$-subgroup of strongly non-extendable corks. The group $\u0398^\u03c4_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ can also be viewed as a refinement of the bordism group of diffeomorphisms. Using our invariants, we furthermore establish several new families of corks and prove that various known examples are strongly non-extendable. Our main computational tool is a monotonicity theorem which constrains the behavior of our invariants under equivariant negative-definite cobordisms, and an explicit method of constructing such cobordisms via equivariant surgery.",

      "summary": "If $G$ is a group which admits a manifold model for $\\mathrm{B}G$ then $G$ is a Poincar\u00e9 duality group. We study a generalisation of Poincar\u00e9 duality groups, introduced initially by Davis and Leary, motivated by groups $G$ with cocompact manifold models $M$ for $\\underline{\\mathrm{E}}G$ where $M^H$ is a contractible submanifold for all finite subgroups $H$ of $G$. We give several sources of examples and constructions of these Bredon-Poincar\u00e9 duality groups, including using the equivariant reflection group trick of Davis and Leary to construct examples of Bredon-Poincar\u00e9 duality groups arising from actions on manifolds $M$ where the dimensions of the submanifolds $M^H$ are specified. We classify Bredon-Poincar\u00e9 duality groups in low dimensions, and discuss behaviour under group extensions and graphs of groups.",

We show that the inertia group $I_{n+1}(\u03c0,w)$ and the closed manifold subgroup $C_{n+1}(\u03c0,w)$ are equal in dimensions $n+1\\geq 6$, for any finitely-presented group $\u03c0$ and any orientation character $w\\colon \u03c0\\to \\cy 2$.",
