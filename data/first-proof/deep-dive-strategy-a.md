## Executive Summary

Strategy A aims to finitize Voiculescu's L^2-projection proof of the free Stam
inequality. The infinite-dimensional proof has six steps: define conjugate
variable J(X), express J(X+Y) via conditional expectation, apply L^2
contractivity, use freeness to kill cross-terms, expand the norm, optimize a
scalar parameter. Each step has a natural finite candidate, but the finitization
encounters real obstacles -- particularly around the projection/conditional
expectation step and the cross-term orthogonality step. This document records
what is known from the literature for each ingredient.

## 1. Finite Conjugate Variables / Finite Score Functions

### What Voiculescu defines (infinite case)

In "The analogues of entropy and of Fisher's information measure in free
probability theory, V" (Invent. Math. 132, 1998, pp. 189-227), Voiculescu
defines the **conjugate variable** J(X) for a self-adjoint random variable X in
a tracial W*-probability space (M, tau). The free Fisher information is:

    Phi*(X) = ||J(X)||^2_{L^2(M,tau)}

For a variable with absolutely continuous law with density rho, the conjugate
variable takes the explicit form:

    J(X) = 2 pi H(rho)(X)

where H(rho) is the Hilbert transform of the density rho. The free Fisher
information then becomes:

    Phi*(X) = 4 pi^2 integral (H rho(x))^2 rho(x) dx

Equivalently (Tao, blog post on fractional free convolution powers, 2020):

    Phi(mu) = (2 pi^2 / 3) integral (d mu / dx)^3 dx

(under a different normalization convention). The key property: J(X) is
the unique element of L^2(M, tau) satisfying a derivation identity with
respect to the algebra generated by X.

  classical entropy"

### The finite candidate: root-force field

For a monic real-rooted polynomial p of degree n with roots lambda_1 < ... < lambda_n,
the natural finite analog of the score/conjugate variable is the **root-force
field** (also called electrostatic score):

    S_i(lambda) = sum_{j != i} 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j)

This satisfies the identity:

    S_i = (1/2) p''(lambda_i) / p'(lambda_i)

and the discrete Fisher information is:

    Phi_n(p) = sum_{i=1}^n S_i^2 = (1/4) sum_i (p''(lambda_i)/p'(lambda_i))^2

With the exact simplification (triple cross-terms cancel):

    Phi_n(p) = 2 sum_{i<j} (lambda_i - lambda_j)^{-2}

**Why S_i is the right candidate:**

1. **Structural match.** In the Dyson Brownian motion SDE, the drift term for
   eigenvalue lambda_i is proportional to S_i. The root-force field is the
   gradient of the log-gas energy, exactly as the classical score is the
   gradient of the log-density. The free score J(X) = 2 pi H(rho)(X) is the
   large-n limit of n^{-1} S_i under appropriate scaling.

2. **Norm match.** Phi_n(p) = ||S||^2 = sum_i S_i^2, directly paralleling
   Phi*(X) = ||J(X)||^2.

3. **Gauss-Lucas / electrostatic interpretation.** The zeros of p' are the
   equilibrium points of the electrostatic field generated by unit charges at
   the roots of p. The score S_i measures the total force on the i-th root
   from all other roots. This electrostatic viewpoint is well-studied
   (Baez, "Electrostatics and the Gauss-Lucas Theorem," 2021; Steinerberger,
   Annals of PDE, 2022).

4. **Calogero-Moser connection.** The quantity Phi_n = 2 sum_{i<j} g_{ij}^{-2}
   (where g_{ij} = lambda_i - lambda_j) is precisely the potential energy of
   the rational Calogero-Moser system with coupling gamma=1 (up to a constant
   factor). This connects to an integrable system with rich conserved-quantity
   structure (see Section 6).

### What is NOT known

- **No formal "derivation identity" for S_i.** In the infinite case, J(X) is
  characterized by a functional equation involving noncommutative derivations
  (del_X). No finite analog of this characterization for S_i has been established.
  The root-force field is just the gradient of an energy functional, not (yet)
  a member of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with projection structure.

- **No L^2 space formulation.** The vector S = (S_1, ..., S_n) lives in R^n,
  and ||S||^2 = Phi_n. But the projection machinery requires more: we need
  an ambient Hilbert space in which projections onto subalgebras are defined.
  In the infinite case, this is L^2(M, tau). In the finite case, R^n with the
  counting measure (or a weighted measure) is the candidate, but the algebraic
  projection structure must be supplied separately.

---

## 2. Projection / Conditional Expectation for Orbital Integrals

### What Voiculescu uses (infinite case)

The critical step is:

    J(X+Y) = E_{W*(X+Y)} [ alpha J(X:Y) + (1-alpha) J(Y:X) ]

where E_{W*(X+Y)} is the conditional expectation (L^2 projection) onto the
von Neumann algebra generated by X+Y, and J(X:Y) is the conjugate variable
of X relative to the algebra generated by {X, Y}. The conditional expectation
is an L^2 contraction, giving:

    ||J(X+Y)||^2 <= ||alpha J(X:Y) + (1-alpha) J(Y:X)||^2

### Finite analog: what would be needed

For p boxplus_n q = E_U[det(xI - A - UBU*)], the roots of the convolution are
NOT the expectations of the random eigenvalues. They are the roots of the
expected characteristic polynomial. This is a fundamentally different object.

A finite projection analog would need:

**(a) A "score vector" for A+UBU* (random matrix level).** For each realization
U, the matrix A+UBU* has eigenvalues nu_1(U) < ... < nu_n(U) with score vector
S(nu(U)). The expectation E_U[S(nu(U))] is a well-defined vector in R^n, but
it relates to the RANDOM eigenvalues, not to the roots of the EXPECTED polynomial.

**(b) A "score vector" for p boxplus_n q (polynomial level).** The roots of
p boxplus_n q are mu_1 < ... < mu_n, and S(mu) is the score of the convolution.
This is the quantity that appears in Phi_n(p boxplus_n q).

**(c) A projection identity connecting (a) and (b).** This is the missing piece.
One would need something like:

    S(mu) = Pi_{sub} [ weighted combination of S(lambda) and S(sigma) ]

where lambda, sigma are roots of p and q, and Pi_{sub} is some projection.

### What the literature offers

**Weingarten calculus (Collins-Sniady, 2006; Campbell-Yin, 2019).** The
Weingarten calculus provides exact formulas for integrals of polynomial
functions over the unitary group U(n) with respect to Haar measure. Campbell
and Yin (arXiv:1907.01009) explicitly compute the expected characteristic
polynomial of randomly rotated matrices using Weingarten methods, confirming
the MSS coefficient formula:

    c_k = sum_{i+j=k} w(n,i,j) a_i b_j,   w(n,i,j) = (n-i)!(n-j)! / (n!(n-k)!)

This gives COEFFICIENT-level linearity but not ROOT-level projection. The
roots of p boxplus_n q are determined by these coefficients via Vieta's formulas,
but the relationship between root-level score and coefficient-level structure
is nonlinear.

**Finite free cumulants (Arizmendi-Perales, 2016; Marcus, 2021).** Finite free
cumulants kappa_m^{(n)} are defined so that:

    kappa_m^{(n)}(p boxplus_n q) = kappa_m^{(n)}(p) + kappa_m^{(n)}(q)

This linearization is the finite analog of free cumulant additivity. But it
operates at the level of symmetric functions of roots (moments/cumulants),
not at the level of individual root positions or score vectors. There is no
known "cumulant-level projection" that maps to a "root-level score projection."

**HCIZ integral (Harish-Chandra, Itzykson-Zuber).** The orbital integral density:

    rho_{A,B}(nu) = [explicit HCIZ-derived formula over Weyl chamber]

gives E_U[f(eig(A+UBU*))] = integral f(nu) rho_{A,B}(nu) dnu. In principle,
one could compute E_U[S(nu)] from this, but:
(i) rho_{A,B} is piecewise-polynomial with complicated support (Horn polytope);
(ii) the relationship between E_U[S(nu)] and S(roots of E_U[char poly]) is
unclear and involves the full nonlinear root-extraction map.

### Assessment

**No direct finite projection identity exists in the literature.** The gap
between "coefficients/cumulants add linearly" and "scores project contractively"
is the central obstacle. The infinite case bridges this via the W*-algebraic
machinery of conditional expectations in L^2(M, tau). The finite case has no
known analog of this bridge.

## 3. Orthogonality Under Haar Averaging

### What freeness gives (infinite case)

The key simplification in Voiculescu's proof: when X and Y are free,

    J(X : Y) = J(X),    J(Y : X) = J(Y)

(relative conjugate variables reduce to ordinary conjugate variables), AND:

    <J(X), J(Y)>_{L^2} = 0    (cross-term vanishes)

This orthogonality is a consequence of freeness: in a free pair (X,Y), the
centered moments of X and Y alternate freely, which forces the inner product
of their conjugate variables to vanish. Expanding the norm:

    ||alpha J(X) + (1-alpha) J(Y)||^2 = alpha^2 ||J(X)||^2 + (1-alpha)^2 ||J(Y)||^2
                                       = alpha^2 Phi*(X) + (1-alpha)^2 Phi*(Y)

No cross-term. This is the structural reason the Stam inequality has the
harmonic-mean form.

### Finite analog: what Haar averaging provides

For the finite free convolution, the Haar unitary U plays the role of the
"freeness generator." The key question: after Haar averaging, do contributions
from the A-spectrum and B-spectrum become orthogonal?

**Weingarten orthogonality.** The Weingarten calculus shows that integrals of
the form:

    E_U[ U_{i1,j1} ... U_{ik,jk} U*_{i'1,j'1} ... U*_{i'l,j'l} ]

vanish unless k = l and the index sets are matched by permutations. This is
a form of "orthogonality" -- unbalanced products of U and U* integrate to zero.

At the level of **first-order statistics** (coefficients of the expected
characteristic polynomial), this orthogonality is responsible for the MSS
bilinear structure: c_k = sum w(n,i,j) a_i b_j, where the weights encode
the Haar averaging.

At the level of **second-order statistics** (variance of the characteristic
polynomial, or products of scores), the Weingarten expansion involves
1/n corrections that do not cleanly separate A-contributions from B-contributions.

**Finite asymptotic freeness.** For large n, random unitary conjugation makes
A and UBU* "approximately free" (Voiculescu's asymptotic freeness theorem).
The cross-terms vanish to leading order in n, with O(1/n^2) corrections.
But we need EXACT orthogonality (or at least an inequality) at finite n.

**What would suffice.** A weakened form would work: instead of exact orthogonality
<S_A, S_B> = 0, we would need:

    <S_A, S_B> <= 0    (nonpositive cross-term)

or even a controlled bound:

    |<S_A, S_B>| <= epsilon(n) * ||S_A|| * ||S_B||

with epsilon(n) < 1. But even this weaker statement has not been established.

**Numerical evidence from our Codex runs.** The Codex Step 4 analysis showed
that 1/Phi_n is NEITHER convex NOR concave in root coordinates or cumulant
coordinates. The Hessian is indefinite 100% of the time for n >= 3. Yet
superadditivity holds. This suggests the cross-term, while not zero, is
controlled by some mechanism that is NOT convexity. The most natural candidate
is a Weingarten-based cancellation at the score level.

### Assessment

**Exact orthogonality almost certainly fails at finite n.** The finite corrections
to freeness are well-studied (genus expansion in Weingarten calculus) and are
generically nonzero. The question is whether the INEQUALITY 1/Phi_n >= ...
survives despite nonzero cross-terms. This is plausible but requires a new
argument beyond Voiculescu's exact-orthogonality technique.

## 4. Log-Gas / Coulomb Gas Score Functions and Fisher-Type Inequalities

### Classical Stam inequality mechanism

The classical Stam inequality for Fisher information:

    1/I(X+Y) >= 1/I(X) + 1/I(Y)

was proved by Stam (1959) and Blachman (1965). The proof uses score-function
decomposition: the score of X+Y is a conditional expectation of the scores
of X and Y, and the conditional expectation is an L^2 contraction.

**Carlen's superadditivity (1991).** Carlen proved a strict superadditivity of
Fisher information: I(X,Y) >= I(X) + I(Y|X), where the chain-rule decomposition
of Fisher information is used. The statistical interpretation (Zamir, 1996):
the Fisher information in a pair (X,Y) is never less than the Fisher information
in the marginal, with equality iff independent. This is a corollary of
monotonicity of the Fisher information matrix.

### Log-gas connection

The log-gas (or beta-ensemble) is the probability measure on ordered
n-tuples (lambda_1 < ... < lambda_n):

    P(lambda) propto prod_{i<j} |lambda_i - lambda_j|^beta * exp(-n sum V(lambda_i))

For beta = 2 (unitary ensemble), the equilibrium measure satisfies a self-
consistent equation involving the Hilbert transform, and the "temperature-1"
dynamics are the Dyson Brownian motion.

The quantity Phi_n = 2 sum_{i<j} (lambda_i - lambda_j)^{-2} is the
**electrostatic self-energy** of the root configuration (Coulomb energy of
the inverse-square type). It is also the potential energy of the rational
Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian.

### Is there a Cramer-Rao for log-gases?

In the classical setting, the Cramer-Rao inequality says Var(theta-hat) >= 1/I(theta),
relating Fisher information to estimation error. For log-gases, the analog would
relate Phi_n to some estimation-theoretic quantity.

**No direct Cramer-Rao analog for log-gases giving superadditivity has been
found in the literature.** The works on discrete Fisher information (e.g.,
Johnson-Yu, arXiv:2009.01137, "Properties of discrete Fisher information")
study lattice analogs, not the spectral/root-gap setting.

The closest result is the **log-Sobolev inequality for beta-ensembles**
(Ledoux, 2003; Guionnet-Zeitouni, 2000): for the GUE log-gas, one has
concentration inequalities for spectral statistics. But these give concentration
bounds, not superadditivity of Fisher-type quantities.

### Assessment

**The log-gas / Coulomb gas literature does not directly provide a
superadditivity inequality for Phi_n.** The connection is suggestive (Phi_n
is the Coulomb self-energy, and classical Fisher information is superadditive)
but no bridge theorem exists.

## 5. Finite Free Entropy / Finite de Bruijn Identity

### What exists in the infinite case

Voiculescu's free entropy chi(X) = integral integral log|x-y| d mu(x) d mu(y)
satisfies the **free de Bruijn identity**: under perturbation by free Brownian
motion (semicircular noise),

    d/dt chi(X + sqrt(t) S) = (1/2) Phi*(X + sqrt(t) S)

where S is a standard semicircular variable free from X. This is the free
analog of the classical de Bruijn identity d/dt H(X + sqrt(t) Z) = (1/2) I(X + sqrt(t) Z).

The free Stam inequality can be derived from this identity combined with the
concavity/monotonicity properties of free entropy under free convolution.

### Finite candidates

**Candidate 1: Log-discriminant.** For a monic polynomial p of degree n with
roots lambda_1 < ... < lambda_n, the log-discriminant is:

    L(p) = sum_{i<j} log(lambda_j - lambda_i)

This is a finite analog of the logarithmic energy chi(mu). Under differentiation
of the polynomial (a finite analog of the heat flow), the roots evolve by the
Gauss-Lucas dynamics. Steinerberger (Annals of PDE, 2022) showed that the
PDE governing root flow under differentiation is:

    partial_t rho + partial_x (rho H(rho)) = 0

which is the same equation as the free convolution evolution. This connects
polynomial differentiation to free probability.

**Candidate 2: Heat-evolved polynomials.** Let p_t(x) = (e^{t Delta/2} p)(x)
where Delta is the Laplacian. Then the roots of p_t evolve, and the empirical
root measure converges (as n -> infinity) to the free convolution of the initial
measure with a semicircular of variance t (Hoskins-Kabluchko, arXiv:2308.11685;
Steinerberger, 2020). The "heat flow conjecture" (arXiv:2202.09660) proposes
an exact description of the limiting root distribution under heat flow.

**Candidate 3: Finite free cumulant generating function.** Arizmendi-Garza-Vargas-
Perales (arXiv:2505.01705) define infinitesimal distributions for finite free
convolutions, with an H-transform that captures O(1/n) corrections to the
R-transform. Their functional relation:

    G_{mu'} = -(R-hat_p compose G_mu) * G_mu' - H_mu

is a finite analog of the free complex-Burgers equation, and could potentially
be differentiated to produce a de Bruijn-type identity.

### What is NOT known

**No finite de Bruijn identity of the form d/dt H_n(p_t) = -(1/2) Phi_n(p_t)
has been proved.** This is identified as "Blocker A" in our Codex synthesis
(step-6-synthesis). The obstacles are:

1. **Which "heat flow" to use.** Polynomial heat flow (convolution with Gaussian),
   Dyson BM flow, or unitary BM flow on the orbit of B? Each gives different
   root dynamics, and none is known to produce a clean de Bruijn identity with
   Phi_n on the right-hand side.

2. **Phi_n is defined from roots, not from the polynomial.** The heat flow
   acts on coefficients (smoothly), but Phi_n depends on roots (nonlinearly).
   The derivative d/dt Phi_n(p_t) involves the Jacobian of the root-extraction
   map, which has singularities at repeated roots.

3. **The Calogero-Moser dynamics give a candidate.** Under the root dynamics
   induced by the heat flow, the positions q_i = lambda_i satisfy:

       dq_i/dt = sum_{j != i} 1/(q_i - q_j) = S_i

   and the "momenta" p_i = S_i satisfy:

       dp_i/dt = -sum_{j != i} 1/(q_i - q_j)^2 * (S_i - S_j)

   The question is whether d/dt L(p_t) = -(1/2) Phi_n(p_t) holds for the
   log-discriminant L under these dynamics. This appears to be:

       d/dt L = sum_{i<j} (S_i - S_j)/(lambda_i - lambda_j)
              = sum_{i<j} S_i/(lambda_i - lambda_j) - sum_{i<j} S_j/(lambda_i - lambda_j)

   which does NOT simplify to Phi_n in any obvious way.

### Assessment

**A finite de Bruijn identity is plausible but unproved.** The right entropy
functional H_n is not yet identified. The log-discriminant is the most natural
candidate, but its time derivative under root dynamics does not cleanly equal
Phi_n. This is a key open problem. If solved, it would likely unlock the
finite Stam inequality via the standard Stam-from-de-Bruijn argument.

## 6. Calogero-Moser Conserved Quantities

### The system

The rational Calogero-Moser system (Calogero 1971, Moser 1975) has Hamiltonian:

    H = (1/2) sum_i p_i^2 + gamma^2 sum_{i<j} (q_i - q_j)^{-2}

where q_i are particle positions, p_i are momenta, and gamma is the coupling
constant. For our setting, the root positions are the q_i, and the score
S_i = sum_{j != i} 1/(q_i - q_j) is related to the drift in Dyson BM.

The quantity Phi_n = 2 sum_{i<j} (q_i - q_j)^{-2} is precisely the
**potential energy** of the Calogero-Moser system with gamma = 1 (up to
normalization).

### Conserved quantities via Lax pair

The Calogero-Moser system admits a Lax pair (L, M) where:

    L_{ij} = p_i delta_{ij} + (1 - delta_{ij}) * i gamma / (q_i - q_j)
    M_{ij} = [explicit formula involving 1/(q_i - q_j)^2 terms]

The conserved quantities are:

    F_k = (1/k) tr(L^k),    k = 1, ..., n

These are functionally independent and Poisson-commute (Etingof, "Lectures on
Calogero-Moser systems," MIT 2006). They form a complete set of integrals
of motion, establishing Liouville integrability.

### Does any conserved quantity relate to 1/Phi_n?

**F_2 = (1/2) tr(L^2) = (1/2) sum_i p_i^2 - gamma^2 sum_{i<j} (q_i - q_j)^{-2}.**

This is the Hamiltonian itself (kinetic minus potential for the Lax formulation).
For the "zero momentum" case (p_i = 0 for all i, or equivalently, the static
configuration):

    F_2|_{p=0} = -gamma^2 * (1/2) Phi_n

So Phi_n is proportional to the Lax F_2 at zero momentum.

**Higher F_k involve mixed terms.** For k >= 3, F_k = (1/k) tr(L^k) involves
products of momenta and inverse gaps that do not simplify to pure functions
of the gaps alone.

### Superadditivity and conserved quantities

**No conserved quantity is known to satisfy superadditivity under any natural
"addition" operation.** The Calogero-Moser conserved quantities are additive
under disjoint union of particle systems (non-interacting subsystems), but
this is not the same as the finite free convolution, which produces a NEW
n-particle system from two n-particle systems with nontrivial mixing.

However, the integrability structure suggests a possible approach:

1. **Isospectral flows.** The Calogero-Moser flow preserves the spectrum of L.
   If one could relate the spectrum of L to the roots of p boxplus_n q, the
   conservation law might give information about Phi_n.

2. **Action-angle variables.** In action-angle coordinates (Kazhdan-Kostant-
   Sternberg, 1978), the Calogero-Moser system linearizes on a torus. The
   action variables are the eigenvalues of the Lax matrix. If the finite free
   convolution corresponds to a specific operation in action-angle space, the
   superadditivity might follow from properties of the action variables.

3. **Superintegrability.** The rational Calogero-Moser model is superintegrable:
   beyond the n involutive integrals F_k, there are n-1 additional independent
   conserved quantities (Wojciechowski, 1983). Some of these involve symmetric
   functions of the momenta and could potentially relate to combinations of
   Phi_n that have better convexity properties.

### Assessment

**The Calogero-Moser connection is structurally suggestive but does not
directly yield superadditivity.** The key missing link is a map between the
finite free convolution operation on polynomials and a natural operation in
Calogero-Moser phase space. The fact that Phi_n is the potential energy of
the CM system is a striking coincidence (or consequence) that has not been
exploited for inequality proofs.

## 7. Synthesis: Step-by-Step Finitization Map

Here is the status of each step in Voiculescu's proof, mapped to finite analogs:

### Step 1: Define conjugate variable J(X) with Phi*(X) = ||J(X)||^2

| Infinite | Finite candidate | Status |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| J(X) = 2 pi H(rho)(X) | S_i = sum_{j!=i} 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j) | GOOD: natural, well-motivated |

| L^2(M, tau) space | R^n with counting/weighted measure | PARTIAL: space exists but algebraic structure unclear |

### Step 2: J(X+Y) = E_{W*(X+Y)}[alpha J(X:Y) + (1-alpha) J(Y:X)]

## 8. Viability Assessment

### Probability of success: 20-30%

This is revised DOWN from the initial 30% estimate in the proof strategy file,
based on the deep literature search revealing that:

1. **No finite projection formula exists.** The gap between coefficient-level
   linearity (MSS formula, finite free cumulant additivity) and root-level score
   projection is real and has not been bridged by anyone.

2. **Exact orthogonality fails.** Finite-n corrections to freeness are well-
   studied and generically nonzero.

3. **No finite de Bruijn identity exists.** An alternative route through de Bruijn
   would bypass the projection, but the right entropy functional is not identified.

### What would raise the probability

**Finding A:** A finite-n identity relating S(roots of E_U[char poly]) to
E_U[f(S(random eigenvalues))] for some specific function f. This would be
the finite projection formula. Weingarten calculus might produce such an
identity, but it would need to be exact, not asymptotic.

**Finding B:** A proof that the cross-term <S_A, S_B> (in whatever sense it
can be defined at finite n) is nonpositive. This is weaker than orthogonality
and might follow from a Weingarten sign analysis.

**Finding C:** A finite de Bruijn identity d/dt H_n(p_t) = c * Phi_n(p_t) for
some entropy functional H_n under some natural heat flow. The Calogero-Moser
dynamics (root flow under polynomial differentiation) are the most natural
candidate flow.

### Recommended concrete next steps

1. **Exact computation for n=4.** Write Delta_4 = 1/Phi_4(p boxplus_4 q) - 1/Phi_4(p) - 1/Phi_4(q)
   in terms of centered coefficients. Use the MSS bilinear map to express c_k
   in terms of a_k, b_k. Clear denominators and test for SOS/positivity. This
   is computationally intensive but does not require the projection machinery.

2. **Weingarten computation of E_U[S_i(eig(A+UBU*)) S_j(eig(A+UBU*))].**
   Compute the second moment of the random score vector. If this has structure
   (block-diagonal in A/B contributions, or a clean cross-term bound), it
   would provide the finite orthogonality ingredient.

3. **Test the Calogero-Moser / de Bruijn candidate.** Numerically compute
   d/dt L(p_t) (log-discriminant) along the heat flow and compare to Phi_n(p_t).
   If the ratio d/dt L / Phi_n is approximately constant across configurations,
   there is a de Bruijn identity waiting to be proved.

4. **Explore the differentiation/minor process route.** Shlyakhtenko-Tao (2020)
   showed that the minor process for free convolution powers satisfies:

       J([pXp] : [pBp]) = k E([pJ(X:B)p] | [pXp], [pBp])

   with conditional expectation being an L^2 contraction. The finite analog
   of this minor/compression identity might be more accessible than the full
   orbital-integral projection.

### Bottom line

Strategy A is the closest to the "true" mechanism of the free Stam inequality.
The finite score (root-force field) is well-defined and well-motivated. But the
projection step -- the heart of Voiculescu's proof -- has no known finite analog.
The strategy is viable if a new ingredient is discovered (the finite projection
formula, or a finite de Bruijn identity, or a cross-term sign theorem). Without
such an ingredient, the strategy cannot close.

The most promising sub-route is the **Shlyakhtenko-Tao minor-process approach**:
their conditional-expectation identity has more concrete matrix-theoretic content
than Voiculescu's abstract W*-algebraic projection, and might be more amenable
to finitization.
