# Problem 8: Lagrangian Smoothing of Polyhedral Surfaces with 4-Valent Vertices

## Problem Statement

A polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in (R^4, omega) is a finite polyhedral
complex whose faces are Lagrangian 2-planes, forming a topological
submanifold. A Lagrangian smoothing is a Hamiltonian isotopy K_t of smooth
Lagrangian submanifolds for t in (0,1], extending to a topological isotopy
on [0,1] with K_0 = K.

If K has exactly 4 faces meeting at every vertex, does K necessarily have a
Lagrangian smoothing?

## Answer

**Yes.**

## Proof

### 1. Local structure at a 4-valent vertex

At a vertex v, four Lagrangian faces L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4 (cyclic order) share
edges e_1 = L_1 cap L_2, e_2 = L_2 cap L_3, e_3 = L_3 cap L_4,
e_4 = L_4 cap L_1 (rays from v). Each face L_i = span(e_{i-1}, e_i), and
the Lagrangian condition gives

    omega(e_{i-1}, e_i) = 0  for each i (mod 4).

### 2. Vertex spanning

**Lemma.** The four edge vectors span R^4.

*Proof.* Suppose they lie in a 3-dimensional subspace H. The restricted form
omega|_H has rank 2 with 1-dimensional kernel ell. Every Lagrangian 2-plane
in H must contain ell (otherwise it projects isomorphically onto H/ell = R^2,
contradicting the non-degeneracy of omega on H/ell). Since each edge
e_i = L_i cap L_{i+1} and both L_i, L_{i+1} contain ell (as Lagrangian planes
in H), we get ell subset span(e_i) for all i. But ell and span(e_i) are both
1-dimensional, so all four edges are proportional — contradicting
dim(L_1) = 2. QED

### 3. Symplectic direct sum decomposition

The omega-matrix in basis (e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4) has omega(e_i, e_{i+1}) = 0
for all i (mod 4), leaving only a = omega(e_1, e_3) != 0 and
b = omega(e_2, e_4) != 0 (nonzero by non-degeneracy and the spanning lemma).
In the reordered basis (e_1, e_3, e_2, e_4):

    omega = diag([[0, a], [-a, 0]], [[0, b], [-b, 0]])

This is a symplectic direct sum R^4 = V_1 + V_2, where V_1 = span(e_1, e_3)
and V_2 = span(e_2, e_4).

Each face decomposes as L_i = (line in V_1) + (line in V_2), automatically
Lagrangian. The Maslov index of the vertex loop vanishes: each factor traces a
back-and-forth path (winding number 0), so mu = mu_1 + mu_2 = 0.

### 4. Vertex smoothing via product structure

In Darboux coordinates adapted to V_1 + V_2, the surface near v is the product
K cap B(v,r) = C_1 x C_2, where C_j is a right-angle corner (union of two
coordinate half-axes) in V_j.

Replace each corner C_j with a smooth curve C_j^{sm} that agrees with C_j
outside a ball of radius delta. The smoothed surface C_1^{sm} x C_2^{sm} is:

- **Lagrangian:** A product of curves in 2-dimensional symplectic manifolds.
  Each curve is 1-dimensional, hence isotropic; the product is Lagrangian
  in V_1 + V_2.
- **Smooth:** The map (t_1, t_2) -> (gamma_1(t_1), gamma_2(t_2)) is a smooth
  immersion (tangent vectors in complementary subspaces).
- **Agrees with K** outside the delta-neighborhood of v.

### 5. Edge smoothing

After vertex resolutions, the remaining singularities are edge creases:
compact arcs where two Lagrangian faces meet. In Darboux coordinates with the
edge along x_1, each face is locally a graph y = grad S_i(x) for quadratic
S_i. The interpolation S_eps(x) = chi(x_1/eps) S_1 + (1-chi) S_2 gives a
smooth Lagrangian graph y = grad S_eps (exact 1-form, hence Lagrangian).

### 6. Global assembly

**Vertex smoothings** are performed in disjoint balls B_i around each vertex
(finitely many, discrete). They commute (disjoint support).

**Edge smoothings** are performed in disjoint tubular neighborhoods of edge
arcs (between vertex ball boundaries). They commute with each other and with
vertex smoothings.

**Compatibility:** Vertex smoothings agree with K on partial B_i (both flat
there). Edge smoothings begin where the surface is flat. The pieces glue to a
globally smooth Lagrangian surface.

### 7. Hamiltonian isotopy

Parameterize each smoothing by width t. As t -> 0, K_t -> K in C^0.

**Edges are Hamiltonian:** The family S_t defines exact Lagrangian graphs in
T*R^2. By the Weinstein neighborhood theorem, the isotopy is generated by
H_t = dS_t/dt on the Lagrangian.

**Vertices are Hamiltonian:** Each C_j^{sm}(t) is a curve isotopy in
(V_j, omega_j) = (R^2, dx wedge dy). In a simply connected 2-manifold, every
isotopy of contractible Lagrangians is Hamiltonian (the flux homomorphism is
trivial; H^1 of each smoothed corner vanishes). The product isotopy on
V_1 x V_2 has Hamiltonian H_1(t) + H_2(t).

**Composition:** All smoothings have disjoint compact support. The composition
of compactly supported Hamiltonian isotopies is Hamiltonian (Ham_c(M, omega)
is a group; McDuff-Salamon, Proposition 3.17). QED
