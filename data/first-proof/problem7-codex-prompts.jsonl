The question asks whether Gamma = pi_1(M) for a closed manifold M whose universal cover M_tilde is rationally acyclic (H_*(M_tilde; Q) = 0 in positive degrees). Confirm: (a) 'rationally acyclic universal cover' is equivalent to M being a rational model for B Gamma, i.e., H_*(M; Q) = H_*(Gamma; Q). (b) The 2-torsion assumption is essential — without it the answer is trivially yes (take X/Gamma for the symmetric space X = G/K).

(a) Classical Smith theory: if Z/p acts on a mod-p acyclic space, the fixed-point set is mod-p acyclic (hence nonempty). For p=2, this means: Z/2 acting on a mod-2 acyclic space must have fixed points => the action cannot be free. (b) Over Q: the proof claims this obstruction vanishes because 2 is invertible in Q. Verify: the transfer argument gives H_*(X/G; Q) -> H_*(X; Q) is injective (or split), which doesn't force fixed points. Confirm: Z/2 CAN act freely on a rationally acyclic space (example: any odd sphere is rationally acyclic after appropriate modification). (c) The key logical point: M_tilde (universal cover) is rationally acyclic, and the Z/2 subgroup of Gamma acts FREELY on M_tilde (because Gamma acts freely on the universal cover by definition of pi_1).

Is it possible that `Gamma` is the\nfundamental group of a closed manifold whose universal cover is acyclic over\n`Q`?\n\n## Status in This Writeup\n\n**Not fully proved here.**\n\nThis revision isolates what is proved unconditionally, what is proved for a\nnearby finite-CW version, and what remains open in the manifold realization\nstep for the torsion case.\n\n## 1. Baseline Geometry\n\nLet `G` be connected real semisimple, `K < G` maximal compact, and\n`X = G/K` contractible. For a uniform lattice `Gamma < G` with torsion,\n`X/Gamma` is a compact orbifold (not a manifold).\n\nSo the torsion-free argument `M = X/Gamma` does not apply directly.\n\n## 2. Cohomological Structure (Unconditional)\n\nFor proper cocompact actions on contractible `X`, the orbifold/Bredon\nframework gives rational Poincare-duality-type structure in dimension\n`d = dim(X)`.\n\nThis is standard in the Brown-Luck orbifold/equivariant cohomology setup.\n\n## 3. Strong Nearby Result: Finite-CW Realization (`FH(Q)`)\n\nA theorem of Fowler gives a concrete criterion for getting a finite CW complex\nwith prescribed orbifold fundamental group and rationally acyclic universal\ncover:\n\n- If a finite group action on a finite complex has all nontrivial fixed-point\n  components of Euler characteristic zero, then the orbifold group lies in\n  `FH(Q)` (i.e., admits a finite CW model with rationally acyclic universal\n  cover).\n\nFowler also gives arithmetic-lattice examples (in odd-dimensional hyperbolic\nsettings) where this criterion applies, yielding lattice extensions in `FH(Q)`.\n\nThis is substantial evidence for the torsion-orbifold direction, but it is a\n**finite-complex** statement, not yet a closed-manifold statement.\n\n## 4. Why This Does Not Yet Solve Problem 7\n\nProblem 7 asks for a **closed manifold** `M` with `pi1(M)=Gamma` and\n`H_*(M_tilde;Q)=0` for `*>0`.\n\nTwo nontrivial upgrades are still needed:\n\n1. `FH(Q)` -> closed manifold with the **same** fundamental group.\n2. Verification of the relevant rational surgery obstruction for the chosen\n   torsion lattice.\n\n## 5. What Existing Manifold Theorems Cover\n\nAvramidi proves rational manifold models for **duality groups with finite\nclassifying space** (`BΓ` finite), producing manifolds-with-boundary (and then\nclosed models via reflection-group constructions) with rationally acyclic\nuniversal covers.\n\nThis theorem package is powerful but is tailored to torsion-free duality-group\ninput. It does not by itself close the torsion-lattice case asked in Problem 7.\n\n## 6. Conditional Theorem (Current Proof-Level Output)\n\nAssume:\n\n- **(E2)** A concrete uniform lattice `Gamma` with an order-2 element is shown\n  to satisfy the finite-complex criterion needed for `Gamma in FH(Q)`.\n- **(S)** The manifold-upgrade surgery obstruction for this `Gamma` vanishes in\n  the required dimension/range.\n\nThen there exists a closed manifold `M` with `pi1(M)=Gamma` and\n`H_*(M_tilde;Q)=0` for `*>0`.\n\nSo the current output is: **conditional yes** under `(E2)+(S)`.\n\n## 7. Practical Next Step to Close the Gap\n\nFor a specific cocompact lattice family with 2-torsion:\n\n1. Prove the fixed-set Euler-vanishing hypothesis needed to place `Gamma` in\n   `FH(Q)`.\n2. Compute (or cite) the exact rational surgery obstruction class for that same\n   `Gamma`.\n3. Execute the manifold-upgrade step with explicit references to the precise\n   surgery theorem used.\n\n## References\n\n- J.

Is the proof complete? Does the answer follow from the stated steps?\n2. Are there unstated assumptions (e.g., about the specific Lie group G, the arithmetic construction of Gamma, and the orientation character for Poincare duality)?\n3. Verify the finite-complex/manifold distinction: does the argument only establish Gamma in FH(Q), or does it actually produce a closed manifold with pi_1=Gamma?\n4. The manifold-upgrade surgery step is the delicate part — verify what is still missing (normal map setup, obstruction computation, pi_1 control).\n5. The Smith theory argument (Section 7) could be challenged — is the distinction between mod-2 acyclicity and rational acyclicity correctly drawn? Could someone construct a counterexample using integral Smith theory?\n6. Check whether the concrete arithmetic examples in Fowler directly give order-2 torsion, or only nearby torsion cases.\n7. Is the confidence level calibrated to the remaining unresolved manifold-upgrade step?\n8.
