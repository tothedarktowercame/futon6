The question asks whether Gamma = pi_1(M) for a closed manifold M whose universal cover M_tilde is rationally acyclic (H_*(M_tilde; Q) = 0 in positive degrees). Confirm: (a) 'rationally acyclic universal cover' is equivalent to M being a rational model for B Gamma, i.e., H_*(M; Q) = H_*(Gamma; Q). (b) The 2-torsion assumption is essential — without it the answer is trivially yes (take X/Gamma for the symmetric space X = G/K).

(a) Classical Smith theory: if Z/p acts on a mod-p acyclic space, the fixed-point set is mod-p acyclic (hence nonempty). For p=2, this means: Z/2 acting on a mod-2 acyclic space must have fixed points => the action cannot be free. (b) Over Q: the proof claims this obstruction vanishes because 2 is invertible in Q. Verify: the transfer argument gives H_*(X/G; Q) -> H_*(X; Q) is injective (or split), which doesn't force fixed points. Confirm: Z/2 CAN act freely on a rationally acyclic space (example: any odd sphere is rationally acyclic after appropriate modification). (c) The key logical point: M_tilde (universal cover) is rationally acyclic, and the Z/2 subgroup of Gamma acts FREELY on M_tilde (because Gamma acts freely on the universal cover by definition of pi_1).

{"node_id": "p7-synthesis", "node_type": "synthesis", "prompt": "You are a mathematical proof verifier reviewing a complete proof.\n\n## Task\n\nReview this proof that a uniform lattice Gamma (with 2-torsion) in a semi-simple Lie group can be realized as pi_1(M) for a closed manifold M with rationally acyclic universal cover. Assess completeness, correctness, and suggest improvements.\n\n## Proof\n\n# Problem 7: Uniform Lattice with 2-Torsion as Fundamental Group of Rationally Acyclic Manifold\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nSuppose Gamma is a uniform lattice in a real semi-simple group, and Gamma\ncontains some 2-torsion. Is it possible for Gamma to be the fundamental group\nof a compact manifold without boundary whose universal cover is acyclic over Q?\n\n## Answer\n\n**Yes.** It is possible.\n\n**Confidence: Medium-low.** The argument relies on surgery theory and the\nFarrell-Jones conjecture, which are known for lattices in semi-simple groups\nbut whose explicit computations are delicate.\n\n## Solution\n\n### 1. Setup and key definitions\n\nLet G be a connected real semi-simple Lie group, K < G a maximal compact\nsubgroup, and X = G/K the associated symmetric space (a non-positively curved\nRiemannian manifold, contractible). Let Gamma < G be a uniform (cocompact)\nlattice containing an element g of order 2.\n\nA compact manifold M with pi_1(M) = Gamma and rationally acyclic universal\ncover M_tilde means: M is a \"rational model\" for B Gamma (the classifying\nspace). Equivalently:\n\n    H_*(M; Q) = H_*(Gamma; Q)  (group homology with rational coefficients)\n\n### 2. The torsion-free case (background)\n\nIf Gamma were torsion-free, the answer is immediate: Gamma acts freely and\nproperly on X, and the quotient M = X / Gamma is a closed manifold with\npi_1 = Gamma and universal cover X (contractible, hence rationally acyclic).\nThese are the classical locally symmetric spaces.\n\n### 3. Obstruction from torsion: the orbifold issue\n\nWith 2-torsion, Gamma does NOT act freely on X. The element g of order 2 has a\nnonempty fixed-point set X^g (a totally geodesic submanifold of X). The quotient\nX / Gamma is a closed orbifold, not a manifold. Its orbifold fundamental group\nis Gamma, but the topological fundamental group of the underlying space may\ndiffer.\n\nHowever, we are not required to use X / Gamma. We seek ANY closed manifold M\nwith pi_1(M) = Gamma and rationally acyclic universal cover.\n\n### 4. Gamma is a rational Poincare duality group\n\n**Key fact:** Since Gamma is a uniform lattice in G, the rational group\ncohomology H^*(Gamma; Q) is isomorphic to H^*(X/Gamma; Q) (the rational\ncohomology of the orbifold). Since X/Gamma is a closed orbifold of dimension\nd = dim(X), the rational cohomology satisfies Poincare duality:\n\n    H^k(Gamma; Q) = H^{d-k}(Gamma; Q)  (with appropriate orientation character)\n\nTherefore Gamma is a rational Poincare duality group of formal dimension d.\n\n### 5. The Farrell-Jones conjecture and surgery\n\nThe closed manifold M we seek must have dimension d (to match the PD dimension)\nand satisfy:\n- pi_1(M) = Gamma\n- The classifying map f: M -> B Gamma induces an isomorphism H_*(M; Q) -> H_*(Gamma; Q)\n\nThe existence of such M is a surgery-theoretic question.\n\n**Step 5a: Normal map.** Start with a degree-1 normal map\nf: M_0 -> B Gamma from some closed d-manifold M_0 that induces the correct\nmap on fundamental groups. Such a map exists by standard surgery theory (for\nd >= 5) using the fact that Gamma is finitely presented and has a finite\nrational classifying space.\n\n**Step 5b: Surgery obstruction.** The obstruction to surgering f into a\nrational homology equivalence (while preserving pi_1 = Gamma) lives in the\nWall group L_d(Z[Gamma]).\n\n**Step 5c: Farrell-Jones isomorphism.** The Farrell-Jones conjecture is\nKNOWN for lattices in semi-simple Lie groups (Bartels-Lück 2012, building on\nFarrell-Jones 1993 for non-positively curved manifolds). This gives:\n\n    L_d(Z[Gamma]) = H_d^{Gamma}(E_{Fin} Gamma; L^{<-infty>})\n\nwhere E_{Fin} Gamma is the classifying space for proper Gamma-actions (which\ncan be taken to be the symmetric space X with its Gamma-action).\n\n**Step 5d: Vanishing of the rational surgery obstruction.** The rational\nsurgery obstruction is computed by:\n\n    L_d(Z[Gamma]) ⊗ Q = H_d^{Gamma}(E_{Fin} Gamma; L ⊗ Q)\n\nBy the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence and the fact that L_*(Z) ⊗ Q = Q\nconcentrated in degrees 0 mod 4, this equivariant homology can be computed\nfrom the rational cohomology of the orbifold X/Gamma and the fixed-point data\nof finite subgroups.\n\nFor suitable choices of G and Gamma (in particular, for hyperbolic lattices\nSO(d,1) with d >= 5 and d odd), the rational surgery obstruction vanishes,\nallowing the construction of M.\n\n### 6. Concrete example sketch\n\nTake G = SO(2k+1, 1) for k >= 3, so the symmetric space is hyperbolic\n(2k+1)-space H^{2k+1} (dimension 2k+1 >= 7, odd). Let Gamma < G be a\ncocompact arithmetic lattice containing an isometric involution (giving\n2-torsion). Such lattices exist by arithmetic construction.\n\nThe symmetric space H^{2k+1} is contractible. The orbifold H^{2k+1}/Gamma has\nodd dimension, so the signature obstruction (which lives in L_{even}) doesn't\ninterfere. The surgery theory in odd dimensions is more flexible: the Wall\ngroup L_{2k+1}(Z[Gamma]) is related to the Whitehead group, and for lattices\nsatisfying Farrell-Jones, this is computable.\n\nThe rational surgery obstruction vanishes (by parity), giving a closed manifold\nM of dimension 2k+1 with pi_1(M) = Gamma and a rational equivalence\nM -> B Gamma. The universal cover M_tilde is then rationally acyclic.\n\n### 7. Why 2-torsion is not an obstruction over Q\n\nThe critical point: Smith theory (which would obstruct the construction over\nZ/2 coefficients) does NOT apply over Q. Specifically:\n\n- Over Z/2: If Z/2 acts on a mod-2 acyclic space, the fixed-point set is\n  mod-2 acyclic (Smith's theorem). This forces fixed points, contradicting\n  a free action.\n\n- Over Q: If Z/2 acts on a rationally acyclic space, there is NO constraint\n  on fixed points. The action can be free. This is because 2 is invertible\n  in Q, so the transfer argument gives isomorphisms without fixed-point\n  contributions.\n\nSince Gamma acts FREELY on M_tilde (it's the universal cover of M with\npi_1 = Gamma), and the Z/2-subgroup acts freely, there is no Smith-theoretic\nobstruction to M_tilde being rationally acyclic.\n\n### 8. Summary\n\n1. Gamma is a rational PD group of dimension d = dim(G/K) (orbifold PD)\n2. The surgery-theoretic obstruction to realizing Gamma as pi_1 of a\n   rationally aspherical closed d-manifold lives in L_d(Z[Gamma])\n3. The Farrell-Jones conjecture (known for these lattices) computes\n   L_d(Z[Gamma]) from equivariant topology of the symmetric space\n4. For suitable choices (odd-dimensional hyperbolic lattices), the rational\n   surgery obstruction vanishes\n5. Smith theory doesn't obstruct over Q (unlike over Z/2)\n6. The resulting manifold M has pi_1 = Gamma with rationally acyclic M_tilde\n\n## Key References from futon6 corpus\n\n- PlanetMath: \"fundamental group\" — pi_1 and covering spaces\n- PlanetMath: \"Poincare duality\" — duality for closed manifolds\n- PlanetMath: \"lattice in a Lie group\" — discrete subgroups\n- PlanetMath: \"acyclic\" — spaces with trivial reduced homology\n\n\n## Wiring Diagram Summary\n\nNodes: 8, Edges: 9\nEdge types: {\"clarify\": 2, \"reform\": 1, \"assert\": 3, \"challenge\": 1, \"reference\": 2}\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Is the proof complete? Does the answer follow from the stated steps?\n2. Are there unstated assumptions (e.g., about the specific Lie group G, the arithmetic construction of Gamma, the dimension constraint d >= 5, the orientation character for Poincare duality)?\n3. The surgery-theoretic step (Section 5) is the most delicate — verify: (a) Does a degree-1 normal map to B Gamma exist? (b) Is the surgery obstruction correctly identified in L_d(Z[Gamma])? (c) Does the Farrell-Jones isomorphism apply to THIS Gamma? (d) Does the parity argument for vanishing actually work when finite subgroup contributions are included?\n4. The Smith theory argument (Section 7) could be challenged — is the distinction between mod-2 acyclicity and rational acyclicity correctly drawn? Could someone construct a counterexample using integral Smith theory?\n5. The concrete example (SO(2k+1,1), k >= 3) — do cocompact arithmetic lattices with 2-torsion in these groups actually exist? Reference: Borel's construction, Vinberg's examples, or Agol's virtual fibering.\n6. Is the confidence 'medium-low' appropriate? The Farrell-Jones conjecture IS proved for these lattices — should confidence be higher?\n7.
