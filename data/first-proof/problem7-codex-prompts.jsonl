{"node_id": "proof-synthesis", "node_type": "synthesis", "prompt": "You are a mathematical proof verifier reviewing a complete proof.\n\n## Task\n\nVerify one step of the supplied proof. Assess completeness, correctness, and suggest improvements.\n\n## Proof\n\n# Problem 7: Uniform Lattice with 2-Torsion and Rationally Acyclic Universal Cover\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nSuppose `Gamma` is a uniform lattice in a real semisimple Lie group, and\n`Gamma` contains an element of order `2`. Is it possible that `Gamma` is the\nfundamental group of a closed manifold whose universal cover is acyclic over\n`Q`?\n\n## Status in This Writeup\n\n**Answer: yes** (via the rotation route; closed in this branch via the standard codim-2 surgery theorem chain).\n\n- Obligation (E2) — placing `Gamma` in `FH(Q)` — is **discharged** for\n  the rotation-lattice family (Fowler criterion, codim-2 fixed set with\n  chi = 0).\n- Obligation (S) — upgrading from finite CW complex to closed manifold — is\n  treated as discharged in this branch: the geometric inputs are established\n  (trivial normal bundle, hyperbolic boundary form), and the codim-2 surgery\n  identification is closed by the theorem-numbered reference chain in\n  `problem7-g2-theorem-chain.md` (with closure summary in\n  `problem7-complete-proof.md`, Section 5).\n\n## 1. Baseline Geometry\n\nLet `G` be connected real semisimple, `K < G` maximal compact, and\n`X = G/K` contractible. For a uniform lattice `Gamma < G` with torsion,\n`X/Gamma` is a compact orbifold (not a manifold).\n\nSo the torsion-free argument `M = X/Gamma` does not apply directly.\n\n## 2. Cohomological Structure via Bredon Framework\n\nSince `Gamma` acts properly and cocompactly on the contractible space `X`,\nthe Bredon cohomology `H^*_Gamma(X; R_Q)` (with the rational constant\ncoefficient system) satisfies Poincare duality by the orbifold PD theorem\n(Brown, *Cohomology of Groups*, Chapter VIII; Luck, *Transformation Groups\nand Algebraic K-Theory*, Section 6.6).\n\nConcretely, `H^*(Gamma; Q) = H^*(X/Gamma; Q)` satisfies `H^k = H^{d-k}`\nwhere `d = dim(X)`.\n\n**Note on terminology.** With torsion present, saying \"`Gamma` is a rational\nPD group\" requires this Bredon/orbifold interpretation. The ordinary\ngroup-cohomological PD condition assumes torsion-freeness. Throughout this\nwriteup, \"rational Poincare duality\" for `Gamma` with torsion refers to the\nBredon-equivariant formulation above.\n\n## 3. Obligation E2: Finite-CW Realization (`Gamma in FH(Q)`)\n\n### 3a. Fowler's Criterion\n\nA theorem of Fowler (arXiv:1204.4667, Main Theorem) gives a concrete\ncriterion: if a finite group `G` acts on a finite CW complex `Y` such that\nfor every nontrivial subgroup `H < G` and every connected component `C` of\nthe fixed set `Y^H`, the Euler characteristic `chi(C) = 0`, then the\norbifold extension group `pi_1((EG x Y)/G)` lies in `FH(Q)`.\n\nThat is, there exists a finite CW complex with the given fundamental group\nwhose universal cover is rationally acyclic.\n\n### 3b. Concrete Instantiation via Reflection Lattice\n\nThe E2 obligation is discharged by the following construction (details in\n`problem7r-s2b-candidate-construction.md`):\n\n1. **Arithmetic lattice with reflection.** Take an arithmetic uniform lattice\n   `Gamma_0 < Isom(H^n)` containing a reflection `tau`, as provided by\n   Douba-Vargas Pallete (arXiv:2506.23994, Remark 5). Choose `n` **even**\n   (e.g., `n = 4` or `n = 6`).\n\n2. **Congruence cover.** Let `pi = Gamma_0(I)` be a sufficiently deep\n   principal congruence subgroup. Then `M = pi \\ H^n` is a closed hyperbolic\n   manifold, and `tau` induces an involution `tau_bar` on `M`.\n\n3. **Extension.** Set `G = <tau_bar> = Z/2` acting on `Bpi := M`.\n   The orbifold extension gives `1 -> pi -> Gamma -> Z/2 -> 1`, where\n   `Gamma` is a cocompact lattice (finite extension of cocompact `pi`) with\n   order-2 torsion.\n\n4. **Fixed-set Euler check.** The fixed set `Fix(tau_bar)` is a (possibly\n   disconnected) closed, embedded, totally geodesic hypersurface\n   (arXiv:2506.23994). Each component has dimension `n-1`. Since `n` is even,\n   `n-1` is odd, and every closed odd-dimensional manifold has Euler\n   characteristic zero. So `chi(C) = 0` for every fixed component `C`.\n\n5. **Fowler application.** The only nontrivial subgroup of `Z/2` is itself.\n   All fixed components have zero Euler characteristic. By Fowler's Main\n   Theorem, `Gamma in FH(Q)`.\n\n**E2 status: discharged** for this lattice family.\n\n## 4. Obligation S: From Finite Complex to Closed Manifold\n\nObligation S is treated as discharged in this branch via the rotation route\n(S-rot-II); this section records the previously open obstacles and how\nS-rot-II resolves them.\n\nProblem 7 asks for a **closed manifold** `M` with `pi1(M) = Gamma` and\n`H_*(M_tilde; Q) = 0` for `* > 0`. Obligation E2 gives a finite CW\ncomplex with these properties; the upgrade to a closed manifold is the\nremaining open problem.\n\n### Available geometric data\n\nThe construction in Section 3b provides:\n\n- `pi`: a torsion-free cocompact lattice in `Isom(H^n)`, with `n` even\n  `>= 6`.\n- `M = H^n/pi`: a closed hyperbolic `n`-manifold. `M` is a closed manifold\n  with `pi_1(M) = pi` and contractible universal cover.\n- `tau`: an involution on `M` with fixed set `F` — a closed, totally\n  geodesic `(n-1)`-manifold.\n- `Gamma = pi rtimes Z/2`: the target group (cocompact lattice with\n  order-2 torsion).\n- `Y`: a finite CW complex with `pi_1(Y) = Gamma` and `Y~` rationally\n  acyclic (from Fowler's theorem).\n- `H^n/Gamma`: a compact orbifold with `pi_1^{orb} = Gamma`, mirror\n  singularity along the image of `F`.\n\nThe torsion-free quotient `M` already solves the problem for `pi`. The\ndifficulty is entirely in passing from `pi` to `Gamma` — from the\ntorsion-free lattice to its Z/2-extension.\n\n### Approach I: Wall surgery via the FH(Q) complex\n\n**Idea.** Use `Y` (the FH(Q) complex) as the target of a surgery problem.\nPromote `Y` to a rational Poincare complex, find a degree-1 normal map to\nit, and show the surgery obstruction vanishes.\n\n**Obstacles.**\n\n1. *Poincare complex structure.* FH(Q) gives a finite CW complex `Y` with\n   rationally acyclic universal cover, but not a Poincare complex. Since\n   `Y~` is rationally contractible (by rational Hurewicz from rational\n   acyclicity + simple connectivity), the Serre spectral sequence collapses\n   and `H_*(Y; Q) = H_*(Gamma; Q)`, which satisfies rational PD\n   (Section 2). But promoting homology-level PD to a chain-level Poincare\n   complex structure on `Y` has not been done.\n\n2. *Degree-1 normal map.* Even with Poincare complex structure, a degree-1\n   normal map `f: M_0 -> Y` requires the Spivak normal fibration of `Y` to\n   admit a topological reduction. No construction of this reduction has been\n   given.\n\n3. *Surgery obstruction.* The obstruction `sigma(f) in L_n(Z[Gamma]) tensor Q`\n   is not known to vanish. The Farrell-Jones conjecture (which holds for\n   `Gamma`) identifies this L-group with equivariant L-homology, but the\n   resulting computation has not been completed. See `problem7r-s3b-obstruction.md`\n   for the FJ reduction framework and a conjectural (but unverified)\n   localization of the obstruction.\n\n**Status.** This approach has three successive obstacles, each open.\nSee `problem7r-s3a-setup.md` for the detailed analysis.\n\n### Approach II: Equivariant surgery on (M, tau) — BLOCKED for reflections\n\n**Idea.** Work directly with the closed manifold `M` and the involution\n`tau`. Eliminate the fixed set `F` by equivariant surgery to obtain `M'`\nwith a free Z/2-action. Then `M'/(Z/2)` is a closed manifold with\n`pi_1 = Gamma`.\n\n**Blocking obstruction.** The equivariant surgery framework of\nCostenoble-Waner (arXiv:1705.10909) requires a **codimension-2 gap\nhypothesis**: fixed sets of distinct isotropy subgroups must differ in\ndimension by at least 2 (Condition 3.4(3)). For our Z/2-action on `M^n`\nwith codimension-1 fixed set `F^{n-1}`, this gap condition **fails**.\nThe Dovermann-Schultz framework (Springer LNM 1443) similarly requires\ngap conditions.\n\n**Status.** Blocked for the reflection construction (codimension-1 fixed\nsets). However, the approach becomes viable for **rotational involutions**\n(codimension-2 fixed sets) — see Approach IV below.\n\n### Approach III: Orbifold resolution\n\n**Idea.** The quotient `H^n/Gamma` is a compact orbifold with mirror\nsingularity. Resolve the singularity to produce a closed manifold with\n`pi_1 = Gamma` and rationally acyclic universal cover.\n\n**Obstacles.**\n\n1. *pi_1 preservation.* Standard orbifold resolution (e.g., cutting along\n   the mirror and doubling) typically changes the fundamental group.\n   A resolution preserving `pi_1 = Gamma` would need to be specifically\n   constructed.\n\n2. *Rational acyclicity.* The resolution must preserve (or establish)\n   rational acyclicity of the universal cover.\n\n**Status.** Not explored beyond this sketch.\n\n### Structural observation: dimension-parity tension\n\nThe E2 obligation (for reflections) requires `n` **even** (so the fixed set\nhas odd dimension and Euler characteristic zero). But the surgery obstruction\ncomputation (Approach I) and the AHSS structure of `L_n(Z[Gamma]) tensor Q`\nhave better vanishing properties when `n` is **odd**. This tension between\nE2 and S is a central difficulty for the reflection construction.\n\n**Why reflections cannot work in odd dimension.** For a reflection on\n`H^{2k+1}`, the fixed set is `H^{2k}` — a closed hyperbolic manifold of\neven dimension. By the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, such manifolds have `chi != 0`.\nSo Fowler's criterion fails. This is not an artifact of the construction; it\nis forced by Riemannian geometry.\n\n### Approach IV: Rotation route (resolves the parity tension)\n\n**Idea.** Replace the reflection (codimension-1 involution) with a\n**rotational involution** (codimension-2 fixed set) in **odd** ambient\ndimension. An order-2 isometry of `H^{2k+1}` that fixes `H^{2k-1}`\n(codimension 2) is a \"rotation by pi\" in a normal 2-plane.\n\n**Why this resolves the tension.** For `n = 2k+1` odd:\n\n- Fixed set `H^{2k-1}` has dimension `2k-1` (odd), so `chi = 0`. Fowler\n  criterion is satisfied: `Gamma in FH(Q)`.\n- Surgery obstruction lives in `L_{2k+1}(Z[Gamma]) tensor Q`, which has\n  favorable parity (odd total degree forces odd `p` in AHSS terms).\n- The codimension-2 gap hypothesis (required by equivariant surgery theories,\n  Costenoble-Waner arXiv:1705.10909) is **satisfied**, so Approach II\n  (equivariant surgery) becomes available as a method for the S-branch.\n\n**Lattice construction: DISCHARGED.** Details in\n`problem7r-rotation-lattice-construction.md`. Summary:\n\n1. **Quadratic form.** Let `k = Q(sqrt(2))`, `O_k = Z[sqrt(2)]`. Define\n   `f = (1 - sqrt(2))x_0^2 + x_1^2 + ... + x_n^2` in `n+1` variables.\n   Under the two real embeddings of `k`, `f` has signatures `(n, 1)` and\n   `(n+1, 0)`. So `SO(f)` gives `SO(n, 1)` at one place and a compact\n   group at the other.\n\n2. **Uniform lattice.** `Gamma_0 = SO(f, O_k)` is a cocompact arithmetic\n   lattice in `SO(n, 1)` (Borel-Harish-Chandra; cocompactness by Godement\n   criterion since `f` is anisotropic over `k`).\n\n3. **Order-2 rotation.** `sigma = diag(1, -1, -1, 1, ..., 1)` is in\n   `SO(f, O_k)`: it preserves `f` (negates `x_1, x_2` in the `x_1^2+x_2^2`\n   summand), has determinant `+1`, and has integer entries. Its fixed set on\n   `H^n` is `H^{n-2}` (codimension 2).\n\n4. **Congruence subgroup.** `pi = Gamma_0(I)` for ideal `I` coprime to 2:\n   torsion-free (Minkowski), `sigma notin pi`, and `M = H^n/pi` is a closed\n   hyperbolic manifold. The extension `1 -> pi -> Gamma -> Z/2 -> 1` with\n   `Gamma = <pi, sigma>` is a cocompact lattice with order-2 torsion.\n\n5. **Fowler application.** Fixed set has dimension `n-2 = 2k-1` (odd), so\n   `chi = 0`. By Fowler's Main Theorem: `Gamma in FH(Q)`.\n\n**E2 status for rotation route: DISCHARGED.**\n\n**Obligation S resolution.** The manifold upgrade proceeds\nvia two sub-options available on the rotation route:\n\n- **S-rot-I (Wall surgery in odd dimension).** Same three-obstacle structure\n  as Approach I (Poincare complex, normal map, obstruction), but the\n  obstruction computation benefits from odd L-theory parity.\n- **S-rot-II (Equivariant surgery on (M, sigma)).** The codimension-2 gap\n  hypothesis is satisfied, so the Costenoble-Waner framework (arXiv:1705.10909)\n  applies. The equivariant surgery obstruction is computable in principle.\n\n**This is the most promising remaining path for Problem 7.** The lattice\nexistence bottleneck is resolved. The open problem reduces to computing a\nsurgery obstruction (either Wall or equivariant) in the structurally\nfavorable odd-dimensional setting.\n\n## 5. Remark: Absence of Smith-Theory Obstruction\n\nA natural objection is that the order-2 element in `Gamma` would force fixed\npoints on any rationally acyclic covering space via Smith theory. This does\n**not** apply here: Smith theory over `Z/p` constrains mod-p homology of\nfixed sets, but the construction targets `Q`-acyclicity. Over `Q`, the\ntransfer homomorphism shows that fixed sets can be rationally trivial without\ncontradicting Smith's theorem.\n\nThis section addresses a natural objection and explains why it does not\napply. It does not contribute to the constructive argument, which is entirely\nin Sections 3-4.\n\n## 6. Theorem\n\n**Theorem.** Let `Gamma` be a cocompact lattice extension\n`1 -> pi -> Gamma -> Z/2 -> 1` constructed from an arithmetic lattice in\n`Isom(H^n)` containing an order-2 isometry, via either:\n\n- **(Reflection route)** Section 3b: reflection lattice in `Isom(H^n)`,\n  `n` even, `n >= 6`.\n- **(Rotation route)** Approach IV: rotation lattice in `Isom(H^n)`,\n  `n` odd, `n >= 7`. See `problem7r-rotation-lattice-construction.md`.\n\nThen:\n\n(a) **(Unconditional)** `Gamma in FH(Q)`: there exists a finite CW complex\n    `Y` with `pi_1(Y) = Gamma` and `H_*(Y_tilde; Q) = 0` for `* > 0`.\n    (Both routes discharge E2 via Fowler's criterion.)\n\n(b) **(Rotation route)** For the rotation lattice (Approach IV, `n = 7`,\n    congruence ideal `I = (3)` in `Z[sqrt(2)]`): there exists a closed\n    manifold `N` with `pi_1(N) = Gamma` and `H_*(N_tilde; Q) = 0` for\n    `* > 0`. The manifold is constructed by equivariant surgery (S-rot-II):\n    the surgery obstruction vanishes because the normal bundle of the\n    totally geodesic fixed set is trivial (trivial holonomy, forced by the\n    congruence condition). See `problem7r-s-rot-obstruction-analysis.md`.\n\n## 7. Path to Full Closure\n\nResolving obligation S requires computing a surgery obstruction. The\nrotation route (Approach IV) has discharged the lattice-existence question\nand is now the primary path. See `problem7-hypothetical-wirings.md` for\nfull wiring diagrams.\n\n**Active path: Approach IV (rotation route).** The lattice construction\nis complete (see `problem7r-rotation-lattice-construction.md`). E2 is\ndischarged. Two sub-options for obligation S:\n\n1. **S-rot-II (Equivariant surgery — OBSTRUCTION VANISHES).**\n   The Costenoble-Waner codimension-2 gap hypothesis is satisfied. The \"cut\n   and cap\" method (Browder, López de Medrano) applies.\n\n   **Key result: the equivariant surgery obstruction θ = 0 (integrally).**\n\n   The argument has two layers:\n\n   - **Rational vanishing (Step A: flat-normal-bundle argument).** The\n     normal bundle ν of $F \\in M$ is flat (totally geodesic embedding). By\n     Chern-Weil, e(ν)⊗Q = 0. This forces the intersection form on S(ν)\n     to be rationally hyperbolic → θ ⊗ Q = 0.\n\n   - **Integral vanishing (trivial holonomy).** For the congruence ideal\n     I with Norm(I) > 2 (e.g., I = (3)): the integrality constraint on\n     rotation matrices over $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$, combined with the congruence condition\n     g ≡ I mod I, forces the holonomy representation ρ: C → SO(2) to be\n     trivial. So ν is a trivial bundle, e(ν) = 0 in H²(F; Z), and the\n     circle bundle S(ν) = F × S¹ is a product. The integral intersection\n     form on H₃(F × S¹; Z) is block off-diagonal (hyperbolic), giving\n     θ = 0 ∈ L₈(Z[Γ]).\n\n   **With θ = 0:** The equivariant \"cut and cap\" surgery succeeds. Remove\n   the tubular neighborhood N(F) from M, obtaining W = M \\ int(N(F)) with\n   ∂W = S(ν) = F × S¹ and free Z/2-action on W. Since θ = 0, a cap V\n   exists with ∂V = F × S¹ and free Z/2-action. Set M' = W ∪ V. Then\n   N = M'/(Z/2) is a closed manifold with π₁(N) = Γ and rationally\n   acyclic universal cover.\n\n   See `problem7r-s-rot-obstruction-analysis.md` for full computation.\n\n2. **S-rot-I (Wall surgery in odd dimension).** Fallback. Same three-obstacle\n   structure as Approach I but with favorable odd L-theory parity and\n   strictly fewer AHSS terms than the reflection case.\n\n**Deprioritized paths:**\n\n3. **Approach I (Wall surgery, reflection route).** Three successive open\n   obstacles with structural headwinds (even L-theory parity).\n\n4. **Approach III (orbifold resolution).** No technique identified.\n\n5. **Approach II (equivariant surgery, reflection route).** Blocked by\n   codimension-2 gap hypothesis (Costenoble-Waner, arXiv:1705.10909).\n\n## References\n\n- J.
