This word had been used exactly $27$ times\nallready (just believe me) and the question ‘what is it?’ had not reached my thinking\nwhatsoever. Okay, good to have a definition (11.1(1) see under),\nbut it triggered me to expect a definition of <em>commutative diagram</em>\nas well. Alas, it was not there. In my intuition I think of a diagram\nhaving a poset as scheme, but I don’t trust that intuition\nenough to take this for granted. So I am asking you here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the definition of a commutative diagram?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n\n<p>11.1 (1) A diagram in a category $\\mathcal{A}$ is a functor $D:\\mathcal{I}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{A}$\nwith codomain $\\mathcal{A}$. The domain, $\\mathcal{I}$, is called\nthe scheme of the diagram.</p>\n"

      "body_html": "<p>Let $\\Gamma=(V,E,s,t)$ be a directed graph ($V$ = vertices, $E$ = edges, $s$ = source, $t$ = target). Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category. A <strong>diagram of shape</strong> $\\Gamma$ <strong>in</strong> $\\mathcal{C}$ is a family of objects $X(v) \\in \\mathcal{C}$ for every vertex $v \\in V$ and morphisms $X(e)$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ for every edge $e \\in E$ such that $s(X(e))=X(s(e))$ and $t(X(e))=X(t(e))$ for all $e \\in E$. Thus, every edge $e : v \\to w$ is mapped to a morphism $X(e) : X(v) \\to X(w)$.</p>\n\n<p>For a path $\\gamma$ in $\\Gamma$ we define a morphism $X(\\gamma)$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ by induction: If $\\gamma$ is the empty path at a vertex $v$, let $X(\\gamma):=\\mathrm{id}_{X(v)}$. If $\\gamma = \\beta \\circ e$ for a shorter path $\\beta$ and an edge $e$, define $X(\\gamma) := X(\\beta) \\circ X(e)$.</p>\n\n<p>The diagram $X$ is called <strong>commutative</strong> if for all vertices $v,w \\in V$ and all two paths $\\gamma,\\gamma'$ in $\\Gamma$ from $v$ to $w$ we have $X(\\gamma)=X(\\gamma')$.</p>\n\n<p>Convince yourself that this coincides with the usual definition for simple examples such as</p>\n\n<p>$$\\Gamma = \\begin{array}{c} \\bullet &amp; \\rightarrow &amp; \\bullet \\\\ \\downarrow &amp;&amp; \\downarrow \\\\ \\bullet &amp; \\rightarrow &amp; \\bullet  \\end{array}$$</p>\n\n<p>There is a close connection between diagrams and functors. If $\\mathsf{Path}(\\Gamma)$ denotes the path category, then functors $\\mathsf{Path}(\\Gamma) \\to \\mathcal{C}$ correspond to diagrams of shape $\\Gamma$ in $\\mathcal{C}$. These in turn correspond to homomorphisms of directed graphs $\\Gamma \\to U(\\mathcal{C})$, where $U(-)$ is the forgetful functor from categories to directed graphs.</p>\n\n<p>If one even regards arbitrary functors (with small domain category) as diagrams, then we may use the same definition of commutativity as above: Every two chains of morphisms between two given objects are mapped to the same morphism.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes one only demands the commutativity condition for certain paths. For example, when dealing with sheaves or simplicial sets, usually a diagram of the shape\n$$\\begin{array}{c} \\bullet &amp; \\rightrightarrows &amp; \\bullet \\\\ \\downarrow &amp;&amp; \\downarrow \\\\ \\bullet &amp; \\rightrightarrows &amp; \\bullet  \\end{array}$$\nis called commutative if the two squares which consist of the two upper resp. lower horizontal morphisms are commutative. </p>\n\n<p>PS: I have just found that these definitions can also be found in Grothendieck’s Tohoku paper. </p>\n"
