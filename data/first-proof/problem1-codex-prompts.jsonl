Let mu be the Phi^4_3 measure on D'(T^3).\nLet psi: T^3 -> R be a smooth nonzero function and T_psi(u) = u + psi the\nshift map. Are mu and T_psi^* mu equivalent (same null sets)?\n\n## Answer\n\n**Yes.** The measures mu and T_psi^* mu are equivalent.\n\n**Confidence: Medium-high.** The argument combines Cameron-Martin theory with\nthe absolute continuity structure of the Phi^4_3 construction, but requires\ncareful treatment of renormalization under shifts.\n\n## Solution\n\n### 1. The Phi^4_3 measure\n\nThe Phi^4_3 measure mu on D'(T^3) is the probability measure formally\nwritten as:\n\n    dmu(phi) = Z^{-1} exp(-V(phi)) dmu_0(phi)\n\nwhere mu_0 is the Gaussian free field (GFF) measure with covariance\n(m^2 - Delta)^{-1} on T^3, and the interaction is:\n\n    V(phi) = integral_{T^3} (:phi^4: - C :phi^2:) dx\n\nHere :phi^k: denotes the k-th Wick power (renormalized product), and C is a\nmass counterterm that diverges under regularization removal.\n\nThe rigorous construction (Hairer 2014, Gubinelli-Imkeller-Perkowski 2015,\nBarashkov-Gubinelli 2020) produces mu as a well-defined probability measure\non distributions of regularity C^{-1/2-epsilon}(T^3).\n\n### 2. Absolute continuity with respect to the GFF\n\n**Key fact:** The Phi^4_3 measure mu is equivalent to (has the same null\nsets as) a reference Gaussian measure mu_0':\n\n    mu ~ mu_0'\n\nwhere mu_0' is a GFF with an appropriately shifted mass.\n\nThis follows from the construction: mu has density exp(-V(phi)) with respect\nto mu_0, and exp(-V(phi)) > 0 almost surely (exponential is always positive).\nThe integrability E_{mu_0}[exp(-V)] < infinity is the key analytical result\nof the construction.\n\n### 3. Cameron-Martin theory for the GFF\n\nFor the Gaussian free field mu_0 on T^3 with covariance C = (m^2 - Delta)^{-1},\nthe Cameron-Martin space is:\n\n    H = H^1(T^3)  (Sobolev space of order 1)\n\nSince psi is smooth, psi in C^infinity(T^3) subset H^1(T^3), so psi is in the\nCameron-Martin space.\n\n**Cameron-Martin theorem:** For any h in H, the shifted Gaussian measure\nT_h^* mu_0 is equivalent to mu_0, with Radon-Nikodym derivative:\n\n    dT_h^* mu_0 / dmu_0 (phi) = exp(l_h(phi) - ||h||_H^2 / 2)\n\nwhere l_h is the linear functional associated to h. In particular:\n\n    T_psi^* mu_0 ~ mu_0\n\n### 4. Shift of the interacting measure\n\nTo compute T_psi^* mu, we need the density of the shifted interacting measure:\n\n    dT_psi^* mu / dmu_0 (phi) = Z^{-1} exp(-V(phi - psi)) * exp(l_psi(phi) - ||psi||_H^2/2)\n\nThe shifted interaction V(phi - psi) expands (using Wick ordering relative to mu_0):\n\n    V(phi - psi) = V(phi) - 4 int psi :phi^3: dx + 6 int psi^2 :phi^2: dx\n                   - 4 int psi^3 :phi: dx + int psi^4 dx\n                   - C(int :phi^2: dx - 2 int psi :phi: dx + int psi^2 dx) + (renorm. corrections)\n\n**Renormalization under shift:** The term 6 int psi^2 :phi^2: dx generates an\nadditional logarithmic divergence (from psi^2 multiplying the Wick square).\nThis is absorbed by shifting the mass counterterm:\n\n    C -> C + 6 ||psi||_{L^2}^2 * (log N correction)\n\nAfter renormalization, V(phi - psi) - V(phi) is a well-defined random variable\nunder mu_0 (and under mu). The dominant fluctuation term is 4 int psi :phi^3: dx,\nwhich has the right regularity:\n\n- :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-epsilon}(T^3) (as a distribution)\n- psi in C^infinity(T^3) (smooth)\n- int psi :phi^3: dx is well-defined (pairing of smooth test function with distribution)\n\n### 5. Integrability and equivalence\n\nThe Radon-Nikodym derivative dT_psi^* mu / dmu involves:\n\n    R(phi) = exp(-(V(phi-psi) - V(phi)) + l_psi(phi) - const)\n\nWe need R in L^1(mu) and R > 0 a.s.\n\n**Positivity:** R > 0 a.s. because it's an exponential. ✓\n\n**Integrability:** The critical term is exp(4 int psi :phi^3: dx) under the\nPhi^4_3 measure. By the log-Sobolev inequality for Phi^4_3 (Barashkov-Gubinelli\n2020), the measure has strong concentration: the tails of int psi :phi^3: dx\nare controlled by the quartic interaction. Specifically:\n\n    E_mu[exp(t |int psi :phi^3: dx|)] < infinity  for all t < infinity\n\nThis exponential integrability follows from the coercivity of the phi^4\ninteraction: the quartic potential dominates the cubic perturbation.\n\nTherefore R in L^1(mu) and 1/R in L^1(T_psi^* mu), giving:\n\n    T_psi^* mu ~ mu  (equivalent measures)\n\n### 6. Alternative argument via the variational approach\n\nBarashkov-Gubinelli (2020) construct the Phi^4_3 measure via the Boué-Dupuis\nvariational formula, which represents:\n\n    -log Z = inf_{u} E[V(phi + int_0^1 u_s ds) + 1/2 int_0^1 ||u_s||^2 ds]\n\nIn this framework, shifting by psi is equivalent to modifying the variational\nproblem by a shift in the drift, which produces an equivalent measure (the\ninfimum shifts by a finite amount, preserving absolute continuity).\n\n### 7. Summary\n\nThe measures are equivalent because:\n1. mu ~ mu_0 (interacting measure equivalent to Gaussian, by positivity of density)\n2. T_psi^* mu_0 ~ mu_0 (Cameron-Martin theorem, since psi in H^1)\n3. V(phi - psi) - V(phi) is well-defined after renormalization\n4. The exponential of the cubic perturbation is integrable (log-Sobolev / coercivity)\n5. Therefore T_psi^* mu ~ mu\n\n## Key References from futon6 corpus\n\n- PlanetMath: \"distribution\" — distributions on manifolds\n- PlanetMath: \"Sobolev space\" — Cameron-Martin space is H^1\n- PlanetMath: \"Gaussian measure\" — reference measure mu_0\n- PlanetMath: \"Radon-Nikodym theorem\" — absolute continuity and RN derivatives\n\n\n## Wiring Diagram Summary\n\nNodes: 8, Edges: 9\nEdge types: {\"clarify\": 2, \"assert\": 4, \"reform\": 1, \"reference\": 2}\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Is the proof complete? Does the equivalence mu ~ T_psi^* mu follow from the stated steps?\n2. Are there unstated assumptions (e.g., about the mass parameter m^2 > 0, smoothness vs. H^1 regularity of psi, the specific form of the renormalization counterterm, the dimension d=3 being critical)?\n3. The exponential integrability claim (Section 5) is the analytical heart — is E_mu[exp(t |int psi :phi^3: dx|)] < infinity for ALL t truly justified, or only for small t? If only small t, does the argument still close?\n4. The chain of equivalences (Section 7) is a potential logical weak point — verify it is not simply 'mu ~ mu_0 and T_psi^* mu_0 ~ mu_0 therefore T_psi^* mu ~ mu' (which would be incorrect). The correct argument requires the shifted RN derivative to be positive and integrable.\n5. The Boue-Dupuis alternative (Section 6) — is this truly independent, or does it implicitly require the same exponential integrability estimates?\n6.
