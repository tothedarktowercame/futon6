The acyclic construction suggests asking which Q-Poincar\u00e9 duality groups act freely on Q-acyclic spaces, i.e., which groups are FH(Q). For example, the orbifold fundamental group \u0393 of a good orbifold satisfies Q-Poincar\u00e9 duality, and we show \u0393 is FH(Q) if the Euler characteristics of certain fixed sets vanish.",

These models have their own advantages and direct comparison might be important. In this note, we present an example of local system of CDGA's which is a non-nilpotent version of an example given by G\u00f3mez-Tato et al., and compute the corresponding $\u03c0_1$-equivariant CDGA. We also see how some homotopy invariants such as homotopy groups and twisted cohomology are algebraically recovered from the equivariant CDGA with this example.
