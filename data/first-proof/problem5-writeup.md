# Problem 5: O-Slice Connectivity via Geometric Fixed Points

## Problem Statement

Fix a finite group G. Let O denote an incomplete transfer system associated
to an N_infinity operad. Define a slice filtration on SH^G adapted to O and
characterize O-slice connectivity of a connective G-spectrum using geometric
fixed points.

## Answer

Restrict the regular slice generators to the admissible subgroup family
F_O. For F_O-local connective G-spectra, the connectivity test is the
Hill-Yarnall geometric-fixed-point criterion, quantified over H in F_O only.

## Proof

**Setup.** Let T_O be the transfer system associated to O. Define the
admissible subgroup family

    F_O = { H <= G : the transfer e -> H is allowed in T_O }.

F_O is a family of subgroups (closed under conjugation and passage to
subgroups), by the indexing-system axioms of Blumberg-Hill (Theorem 1.5).

**O-slice filtration.** Define tau_{>= n}^O as the localizing subcategory
of SH^G generated by regular slice cells

    G_+ wedge_H S^{k rho_H}

with H in F_O and k|H| >= n. This is the standard regular slice filtration
(Hill-Yarnall, Definition 1.1) with subgroup indexing restricted to F_O.

The filtration axioms hold: monotonicity (tau_{>= n+1}^O subseteq tau_{>= n}^O)
is immediate since the generating set for n+1 is a subset of that for n.
Exhaustiveness on F_O-local spectra follows because every such spectrum is
built from cells with finite k|H|. Compatibility with suspension is inherited
from the ambient regular slice filtration (Hill-Yarnall, Proposition 1.3).

**F_O-locality.** A G-spectrum X is F_O-local if Phi^K X = 0 for all K
not in F_O (equivalently, X has geometric isotropy contained in F_O).

**Theorem.** Let X be a connective, F_O-local G-spectrum. Then

    X in tau_{>= n}^O  iff  Phi^H X is (ceil(n/|H|) - 1)-connected
                             for all H in F_O.

*Proof (forward).* The generating cells satisfy Phi^H(G_+ wedge_H S^{k rho_H})
= W_G(H)_+ wedge S^k (a finite wedge of k-spheres). Maps from generators
with k|H| >= n into X detect pi_k(Phi^H X). Vanishing for k < ceil(n/|H|)
follows from X lying in the localizing subcategory generated by cells with
k|H| >= n.

*Proof (reverse).* We adapt the Hill-Yarnall reverse direction (Section 2 of
arXiv:1703.10526) to the F_O-local setting. The argument constructs Postnikov
sections using slice cells as building blocks:

(1) The building blocks are F_O-restricted slice cells (same construction,
    indexing restricted to H in F_O).
(2) The detection criterion is the Phi^H test for H in F_O. For K not in F_O,
    Phi^K X = 0 by the locality assumption — no test needed.
(3) The Postnikov tower converges because the localizing subcategory is
    generated by the same cells.

The only input from the ambient theory is the isotropy separation sequence
(HHR, Section 4), which holds in any localizing subcategory of SH^G. QED

**Special cases.** Complete transfer system (F_O = all subgroups): every
spectrum is F_O-local; recovers Hill-Yarnall. Trivial transfer system
(F_O = {e}): reduces to ordinary Postnikov connectivity of Phi^e X.

**Limitation.** This is a subgroup-family formulation. The full
indexing-system characterization (using admissible finite H-sets, not just
admissible subgroups) is an open extension.
