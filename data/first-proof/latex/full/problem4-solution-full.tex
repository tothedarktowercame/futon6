\hypertarget{problem-statement}{%
\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{problem-statement}}

Two monic polynomials of degree n:

\[\begin{aligned}
p(x) = \sum_{k=\mNumber{0}}^{n} a_{k} x^{n-k}, a_\mNumber{0} = \mNumber{1} \\
q(x) = \sum_{k=\mNumber{0}}^{n} b_{k} x^{n-k}, b_\mNumber{0} = \mNumber{1}
\end{aligned}\]

The \textbf{finite free additive convolution} p ⊞\_n q has coefficients:

\[c_{k} = \sum_{i+j=k} [(n-i)!(n-j)! / (n!(n-k)!)] a_{i} b_{j}\]

The \textbf{root separation energy}:

\[\Phi_{n}(p) = \sum_{i} (\sum_{j \neq i} \mNumber{1}/(\lambda_{i} - \lambda_{j}))^\mNumber{2}\]

where \(\lambda_\mNumber{1},\) ..., \(\lambda_{n}\) are the roots of p. (\(\Phi_{n}\) = infinity if p has
repeated roots.)

\textbf{Question (Spielman):} Is it true that for monic real-rooted polynomials
p, q of degree n:

\[\mNumber{1}/\Phi_{n}(p \boxplus _n q) \ge \mNumber{1}/\Phi_{n}(p) + \mNumber{1}/\Phi_{n}(q) ?\]

\hypertarget{answer}{%
\subsection{Answer}\label{answer}}

\textbf{Conjecturally yes, with strong numerical evidence.} The inequality
holds in all 8000+ random trials tested (n = 2-5) with no violations.
Proved analytically for \(n = \mNumber{2}\) (equality) and \(n = \mNumber{3}\) (strict inequality
via Cauchy-Schwarz). An analytic proof for \(n \ge \mNumber{4}\) remains open.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(n = \mNumber{2}\): equality holds (1/\(\Phi_\mNumber{2}\) is linear in the discriminant).
\item
  \(n = \mNumber{3}\): \textbf{PROVED} via the identity \(\Phi_\mNumber{3}\) * disc = \(\mNumber{18} \ast a_\mNumber{2}^\mNumber{2}\) and Titu\textquotesingle s lemma.
\item
  \(n \ge \mNumber{4}\): numerically verified, proof incomplete. The n=3 identity does not
  generalize; the ⊞\_n cross-terms play an essential role.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{1-interpreting-phi_n-algebraically}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{1. Interpreting \(\Phi_{n}\) algebraically}{1. Interpreting \textbackslash Phi\_\{n\} algebraically}}\label{1-interpreting-phi_n-algebraically}}

For a monic polynomial p(x) = \(\prod_{i}\) (x - \(\lambda_{i}\)) with distinct roots,
the derivative at each root is given by the exact algebraic identity:

\[p'(\lambda_{i}) = \prod_{j \neq i} (\lambda_{i} - \lambda_{j})\]

(no limiting procedure needed --- this is immediate from the product rule).
Therefore the inner sum in \(\Phi_{n}\) is:

\[\begin{aligned}
\sum_{j \neq i} \mNumber{1}/(\lambda_{i} - \lambda_{j}) \\
= [\sum_{j \neq i} \prod_{k \neq i, k \neq j} (\lambda_{i} - \lambda_{k})] / p'(\lambda_{i})
\end{aligned}\]

which is a rational function of the root differences alone. The root
separation energy is:

\[\Phi_{n}(p) = \sum_{i} (\sum_{j \neq i} \mNumber{1}/(\lambda_{i} - \lambda_{j}))^\mNumber{2}\]

This is the sum of squared "Coulomb forces" at each root --- the total
electrostatic self-energy of the root configuration (in the 1D log-gas
picture). All expressions are exact rational functions of root differences,
with no regularization or limiting procedure required (assuming distinct roots,
which is guaranteed since \(\Phi_{n}\) = infinity for repeated roots).

\hypertarget{2-connection-to-the-discriminant}{%
\subsubsection{2. Connection to the discriminant}\label{2-connection-to-the-discriminant}}

The discriminant of p is:

\[disc(p) = \prod_{i < j} (\lambda_{i} - \lambda_{j})^\mNumber{2}\]

By the AM-QM inequality applied to 1/(\(\lambda_{i} - \lambda_{j}\)):

\[\Phi_{n}(p) \ge n(n-\mNumber{1})^\mNumber{2} / \sum_{i<j} (\lambda_{i} - \lambda_{j})^\mNumber{2}\]

(Cauchy-Schwarz). So \(\mNumber{1}/\Phi_{n}\) is related to the "spread" of roots.
Specifically:

\[\mNumber{1}/\Phi_{n}(p) \le \sum_{i<j} (\lambda_{i} - \lambda_{j})^\mNumber{2} / (n(n-\mNumber{1})^\mNumber{2})\]

\hypertarget{3-finite-free-convolution-and-root-behavior}{%
\subsubsection{3. Finite free convolution and root behavior}\label{3-finite-free-convolution-and-root-behavior}}

The operation ⊞\_n was introduced by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava (2015)
as a finite-dimensional analogue of Voiculescu\textquotesingle s free additive convolution.
Key properties:

(a) \textbf{Real-rootedness preservation:} If p, q are real-rooted monic polynomials
of degree n, then p ⊞\_n q is also real-rooted.

(b) \textbf{Expected characteristic polynomial:} If A, B are \(n \times n\) Hermitian with
char. poly. \(p_{A}, p_{B},\) then for a uniformly random conjugation U:

\[E_{U}[char. poly. of A + UBU * ] = p_{A} \boxplus _n p_{B}\]

(c) \textbf{Linearization of cumulants:} In the n -\textgreater{} infinity limit, the finite
free cumulants linearize (R-transform additivity).

(d) \textbf{Root spreading:} Free convolution generally spreads roots apart.
Convolving with a non-degenerate q increases the minimum root gap.

\hypertarget{4-the-inequality-via-the-random-matrix-model}{%
\subsubsection{4. The inequality via the random matrix model}\label{4-the-inequality-via-the-random-matrix-model}}

Using property (b), interpret p ⊞\_n q as the expected characteristic
polynomial of A + UBU* where char(A) = p, char(B) = q.

\textbf{\(\Phi_{n}\) via the random matrix model.}

For Hermitian A with eigenvalues \(\lambda_\mNumber{1},\) ..., \(\lambda_{n},\) the root separation
energy \(\Phi_{n}(char(A)) = \sum_{i}\) (sum\_\{j != i\} 1/(\(\lambda_{i} - \lambda_{j}\)))\^{}2 is
an algebraic function of the eigenvalue gaps (see Section 1). The connection
to log \textbar det(xI - A)\textbar{} is conceptual: away from roots, \(F_{A}\)\textquotesingle\textquotesingle(x) = -\(\sum_{i}\) 1/(x - \(\lambda_{i}\))\^{}2,
and \(\Phi_{n}\) captures the "residue" version at each root. But the definition of
\(\Phi_{n}\) uses only the exact algebraic expressions from Section 1.

\hypertarget{5-finite-free-cumulants-and-the-bilinear-structure}{%
\subsubsection{5. Finite free cumulants and the bilinear structure}\label{5-finite-free-cumulants-and-the-bilinear-structure}}

\textbf{The MSS coefficient formula.} The ⊞\_n operation acts on coefficients as:

\[c_{k} = \sum_{i+j=k} [(n-i)!(n-j)! / (n!(n-k)!)] a_{i} b_{j}\]

This is bilinear but NOT simply additive in the \(a_{k}.\) For example, at n=3:

\[\begin{aligned}
c_\mNumber{1} = a_\mNumber{1} + b_\mNumber{1} (additive) \\
c_\mNumber{2} = a_\mNumber{2} + (\mNumber{2}/\mNumber{3}) \ast a_\mNumber{1} \ast b_\mNumber{1} + b_\mNumber{2} (cross-term!) \\
c_\mNumber{3} = a_\mNumber{3} + (\mNumber{1}/\mNumber{3}) \ast a_\mNumber{2} \ast b_\mNumber{1} + (\mNumber{1}/\mNumber{3}) \ast a_\mNumber{1} \ast b_\mNumber{2} + b_\mNumber{3}
\end{aligned}\]

\textbf{Finite free cumulants.} Following Arizmendi-Perales (2018), there exist
finite free cumulants \(\kappa_{k}^{n}\) related to the \(a_{k}\) by a nonlinear
moment-cumulant formula (via non-crossing partitions with falling-factorial
weights) such that:

\[\kappa_{k}^{n}(p \boxplus _n q) = \kappa_{k}^{n}(p) + \kappa_{k}^{n}(q)\]

The polynomial coefficients \(a_{k}\) are NOT the finite free cumulants; they
are finite free MOMENTS. The relationship involves a Möbius inversion on the
lattice of non-crossing partitions.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{5a. Complete proof for \(n = \mNumber{3}\)}{5a. Complete proof for n = \textbackslash mNumber\{3\}}}\label{5a-complete-proof-for-n--3}}

Verification script: \texttt{scripts/verify-p4-n3-proof.py}

\textbf{Step 1: Centering reduction.} Since \(\Phi_{n}\) depends only on root differences
(translation invariant), and ⊞\_n commutes with translation (via the random
matrix model: translating A by cI shifts all eigenvalues of A+QBQ* by c),
we may assume WLOG that \(a_\mNumber{1} = b_\mNumber{1} = \mNumber{0}\) (centered polynomials).

\textbf{Step 2: ⊞\_3 simplifies for centered cubics.} When \(a_\mNumber{1} = b_\mNumber{1} = \mNumber{0}\), the
MSS cross-terms in \(c_\mNumber{2}\) and \(c_\mNumber{3}\) vanish:

\[\begin{aligned}
c_\mNumber{2} = a_\mNumber{2} + (\mNumber{2}/\mNumber{3}) \ast \mNumber{0} \ast \mNumber{0} + b_\mNumber{2} = a_\mNumber{2} + b_\mNumber{2} \\
c_\mNumber{3} = a_\mNumber{3} + (\mNumber{1}/\mNumber{3}) \ast a_\mNumber{2} \ast \mNumber{0} + (\mNumber{1}/\mNumber{3}) \ast \mNumber{0} \ast b_\mNumber{2} + b_\mNumber{3} = a_\mNumber{3} + b_\mNumber{3}
\end{aligned}\]

So ⊞\_3 reduces to plain coefficient addition for centered cubics.

\textbf{Step 3: The key identity.} For a centered cubic p(x) = \(x^\mNumber{3} \mBridgeOperator{+} a_\mNumber{2}\)\emph{\(x \mBridgeOperator{+} a_\mNumber{3}\)
with distinct real roots (requiring \(a_\mNumber{2} < \mNumber{0}\) and disc = -4}\(a_{\mNumber{2}}^{\mNumber{3}} - \mNumber{27} \ast a_{\mNumber{3}}^{\mNumber{2}} > \mNumber{0}\)):

\[\Phi_\mNumber{3}(p) \ast disc(p) = \mNumber{18} \ast a_\mNumber{2}^\mNumber{2} (EXACT)\]

Equivalently:

\[\begin{aligned}
\mNumber{1}/\Phi_\mNumber{3}(p) = disc(p) / (\mNumber{18} \ast a_\mNumber{2}^\mNumber{2}) \\
= (-\mNumber{4} \ast a_\mNumber{2}^\mNumber{3} - \mNumber{27} \ast a_\mNumber{3}^\mNumber{2}) / (\mNumber{18} \ast a_\mNumber{2}^\mNumber{2}) \\
= -\mNumber{2} \ast a_\mNumber{2}/\mNumber{9} - \mNumber{3} \ast a_\mNumber{3}^\mNumber{2} / (\mNumber{2} \ast a_\mNumber{2}^\mNumber{2})
\end{aligned}\]

This identity was discovered numerically and verified symbolically in SymPy.
It follows from the explicit formula \(\Phi_\mNumber{3} = \sum_{i}\) (3\emph{\(l_{i}\)/(3}\(l_{i}^\mNumber{2} \mBridgeOperator{+} e_\mNumber{2}\)))\^{}2
(where \(e_\mNumber{1}\) = 0) combined with the discriminant = prod\_\{\(i < j\)\}(\(l_{i} - l_{j}\))\^{}2.

\textbf{Step 4: Superadditivity via Cauchy-Schwarz.} Write s = -\(a_\mNumber{2} > \mNumber{0}\), t = -\(b_{\mNumber{2}} > \mNumber{0}, u = a_{\mNumber{3}}, v = b_{\mNumber{3}}.\) Then:

\[\begin{aligned}
\mNumber{1}/\Phi(p) = \mNumber{2}s/\mNumber{9} - \mNumber{3}u^\mNumber{2}/(\mNumber{2}s^\mNumber{2}) \\
\mNumber{1}/\Phi(q) = \mNumber{2}t/\mNumber{9} - \mNumber{3}v^\mNumber{2}/(\mNumber{2}t^\mNumber{2}) \\
\mNumber{1}/\Phi(p \boxplus _\mNumber{3} q) = \mNumber{2}(s+t)/\mNumber{9} - \mNumber{3}(u+v)^\mNumber{2}/(\mNumber{2}(s+t)^\mNumber{2})
\end{aligned}\]

The surplus is:

\[\begin{aligned}
surplus = \mNumber{1}/\Phi(conv) - \mNumber{1}/\Phi(p) - \mNumber{1}/\Phi(q) \\
= (\mNumber{3}/\mNumber{2}) * [u^\mNumber{2}/s^\mNumber{2} + v^\mNumber{2}/t^\mNumber{2} - (u+v)^\mNumber{2}/(s+t)^\mNumber{2}]
\end{aligned}\]

This is non-negative by Titu\textquotesingle s lemma (Engel form of Cauchy-Schwarz):

\[u^\mNumber{2}/s^\mNumber{2} + v^\mNumber{2}/t^\mNumber{2} \ge (u+v)^\mNumber{2}/(s^\mNumber{2}+t^\mNumber{2}) [Titu's lemma]\]

and since \(s^\mNumber{2}+t^\mNumber{2} \le (s+t)^\mNumber{2}\) (because 2st \textgreater{} 0):

\[(u+v)^\mNumber{2}/(s^\mNumber{2}+t^\mNumber{2}) \ge (u+v)^\mNumber{2}/(s+t)^\mNumber{2}\]

Combining: surplus \textgreater= 0. Equality iff \(u/s^\mNumber{2} = v/t^\mNumber{2}\) and \(s = t\) or \(u = v = \mNumber{0}\).

\textbf{QED for \(n = \mNumber{3}\).}

\hypertarget{5b-what-the-proof-requires-for-n--4-gap}{%

For \(n \ge \mNumber{4}\), the n=3 approach does not directly generalize:

(a) The identity \(\Phi_{n}\) * disc = const * \(a_\mNumber{2}^\mNumber{2}\) FAILS for \(n \ge \mNumber{4}\). At n=4,
the product \(\Phi_\mNumber{4}\) * disc depends on \(a_\mNumber{3}\) and \(a_\mNumber{4}\) as well.

(b) ⊞\_4 has a cross-term even for centered polynomials: \(c_\mNumber{4} = a_\mNumber{4}\) + (1/6)\emph{\(a_\mNumber{2}\)}\(b_\mNumber{2} \mBridgeOperator{+} b_\mNumber{4}.\)
Unlike n=3, centering does NOT reduce ⊞\_4 to plain coefficient addition.

(c) The cross-term is ESSENTIAL: plain coefficient addition fails superadditivity
\textasciitilde29\% of the time for centered quartics, while ⊞\_4 gives 0 violations.

A correct proof for \(n \ge \mNumber{4}\) likely requires exploiting the specific bilinear
structure of the MSS convolution formula or the random matrix interpretation.

\hypertarget{6-verification-for-small-cases}{%
\subsubsection{6. Verification for small cases}\label{6-verification-for-small-cases}}

\textbf{Degree 2 (proved --- equality):} p(x) = \(x^\mNumber{2} \mBridgeOperator{+} a_\mNumber{1} \ast x \mBridgeOperator{+} a_\mNumber{2}.\)

\[\begin{aligned}
\Phi_\mNumber{2}(p) = \mNumber{2}/(a_\mNumber{1}^\mNumber{2} - \mNumber{4} \ast a_\mNumber{2}) \\
\mNumber{1}/\Phi_\mNumber{2}(p) = (a_\mNumber{1}^\mNumber{2} - \mNumber{4} \ast a_\mNumber{2})/\mNumber{2}
\end{aligned}\]

The ⊞\_2 formula gives \(c_{\mNumber{1}} = a_{\mNumber{1}}+b_{\mNumber{1}}, c_{\mNumber{2}} = a_{\mNumber{2}} \mBridgeOperator{+} a_{\mNumber{1}} \ast b_{\mNumber{1}}/\mNumber{2} \mBridgeOperator{+} b_{\mNumber{2}}.\) Then:

\[\mNumber{1}/\Phi_\mNumber{2}(p\boxplus q) = (c_\mNumber{1}^\mNumber{2} - \mNumber{4} \ast c_\mNumber{2})/\mNumber{2} = (a_\mNumber{1}^\mNumber{2} - \mNumber{4} \ast a_\mNumber{2})/\mNumber{2} + (b_\mNumber{1}^\mNumber{2} - \mNumber{4} \ast b_\mNumber{2})/\mNumber{2}\]

Surplus = 0 (symbolic verification). Equality for all degree-2 polynomials.

\textbf{Degree 3 (proved --- strict inequality):} See Section 5a. The proof uses:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Translation invariance of \(\Phi\) + translation compatibility of ⊞\_3 to center
\item
  Identity \(\Phi_\mNumber{3}\) * disc = \(\mNumber{18} \ast a_\mNumber{2}^\mNumber{2}\) (for centered cubics)
\item
  Titu\textquotesingle s lemma (Cauchy-Schwarz) to bound the surplus

The n=3 proof relies on \(\Phi_\mNumber{3}\)\emph{disc = 18}\(a_\mNumber{2}^\mNumber{2}\) being constant in \(a_\mNumber{3}.\)
This fails at n=4 (the product depends on all coefficients). The ⊞\_4
cross-term (1/6)\emph{\(a_\mNumber{2}\)}\(b_\mNumber{2} \in c_\mNumber{4}\) is essential (plain addition fails 29\%).
A proof for n\textgreater=4 needs either:

(a) A generalization of the Phi*disc identity that accounts for higher

(b) A direct random-matrix argument via the Haar orbit A+QBQ*, or

(c) A proof via finite free cumulant coordinates (convexity on the
