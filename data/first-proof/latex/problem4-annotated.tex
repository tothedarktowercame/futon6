\section{Problem 4: Root Separation Energy Under Finite Free Convolution ($n=4$)}

\subsection*{Problem statement}
For monic real-rooted degree-$n$ polynomials, test
\[
\frac{1}{\Phi_n(p \boxplus_n q)} \ge \frac{1}{\Phi_n(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_n(q)}.
\]

\subsection*{Status from current writeup}
Proved for $n\le 4$ in the project writeups, with computational certification components; open for larger $n$.

\subsection*{Annotated proof structure}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5em]
\item Algebraic reduction at $n=4$: normalize coefficients, derive a polynomial numerator/denominator formulation for the surplus using the exact $\Phi_4\cdot\mathrm{disc}$ identity\footnote{Discriminant refresher: \url{https://planetmath.org/discriminantofapolynomial}.}.
\item Show denominator sign on the real-rooted domain, reducing inequality to nonnegativity of a single polynomial $-N$.
\item Boundary and symmetric-subcase analysis by exact elimination/resultant methods.
\item Generic critical-point branch handled computationally (PHC/homotopy-style root accounting) in the current workflow.
\end{enumerate}

\statusnote{Problem 4 is proved for $n \le 3$ analytically (Cauchy--Schwarz); the $n=4$ case has algebraic reduction plus computational verification (PHCpack) but full certification of Case~3c path accounting is pending. Higher $n$ remains open.}
