\section{Problem 7: Uniform Lattice with 2-Torsion and Rationally Acyclic Universal Cover}

\subsection*{Problem statement}
Can a cocompact lattice $\Gamma$ in a real semisimple Lie group, containing an element of order $2$, be the fundamental group of a closed manifold whose universal cover is $\mathbb Q$-acyclic?

\subsection*{Current status}
Closed in the current project branch via the rotation route (\(n=7\), congruence setting): E2 is discharged and the S-branch is closed by the codim-2 surgery theorem chain documented in \texttt{problem7-g2-theorem-chain.md}.

\subsection*{Annotated proof structure}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5em]
\item Use Fowler's fixed-point Euler-characteristic criterion to produce groups in $\mathrm{FH}(\mathbb Q)$ from suitable $\mathbb Z/2$-extensions\footnote{Fowler: \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4667}.}.
\item Construct two arithmetic lattice routes:
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
  \item reflection route in even dimension;
  \item codimension-2 rotation route in odd dimension (arithmetically cleaner for surgery).
  \end{itemize}
\item Follow the rotation-route S-branch: codimension-2 setup, obstruction chain, and cap/gluing output to a closed manifold model with rationally acyclic universal cover.
\end{enumerate}

\statusnote{This monograph tracks Problem 7 as closed in the rotation-route branch. The construction uses Fowler's \(\mathrm{FH}(\mathbb Q)\) criterion and codimension-2 equivariant surgery in the \(n=7\) congruence-lattice setting, with the obstruction-vanishing bridge justified by the project's theorem-number ledger (\texttt{data/first-proof/problem7-g2-theorem-chain.md}).
