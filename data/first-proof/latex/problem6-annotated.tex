\section{Problem 6: $\varepsilon$-Light Vertex Subsets of Graphs}

\subsection*{Problem statement}
Find a universal constant $c_0>0$ such that every weighted graph and every $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$ admit a subset $S$ with
\[
|S|\ge c_0\varepsilon n,\qquad L_{G[S]}\preceq \varepsilon L_G.
\]

\subsection*{Current status}
Conditional. Cases 1 and 2a are proved with $c_0=1/3$; Case 2b is reduced to one remaining operator-averaging conjecture (GPL-H).

\subsection*{Annotated proof structure}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5em]
\item Use leverage scores $\tau_e=w_eR_{\mathrm{eff}}(u,v)$ to define the heavy-edge graph and show any $\varepsilon$-light set must be independent there.
\item Apply the leverage-score trace identity and Turan's theorem to extract a large candidate set.
\item Resolve easy branches (independent-in-$G$ and directly bounded spectral sum) unconditionally.
\item Reduce the hard branch to a barrier-style iterative selection claim (GPL-H), with substantial computational evidence but no final general proof.
\end{enumerate}

\gapnote{The only unresolved logical step is GPL-H in Case 2b. The writeup already isolates this as a single conjectural averaging bound. Until GPL-H (or an equivalent replacement lemma) is proved, the universal-constant theorem remains conditional.}
