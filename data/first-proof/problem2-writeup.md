# Problem 2: Universal Test Vector for Rankin-Selberg Integrals

## Problem Statement

Let F be a non-archimedean local field with ring of integers o. Let Pi be a
generic irreducible admissible representation of GL_{n+1}(F), realized in its
Whittaker model W(Pi, psi^{-1}). Must there exist W in W(Pi, psi^{-1}) such
that for any generic irreducible pi of GL_n(F), with conductor ideal q and
Q generating q^{-1}, there exists V in W(pi, psi) making the twisted
Rankin-Selberg integral

    I(s, W, V) = int_{N_n\GL_n} W(diag(g,1) u_Q) V(g) |det g|^{s-1/2} dg

finite and nonzero for all s in C?

## Answer

**Yes.** The new vector (essential Whittaker function) W_0 of Pi is such a
universal test vector.

## Proof

**Step 1. Algebraic reduction.** For a rational function f(q_F^{-s}) to be
finite and nonzero for all s in C, it must be a monomial c q_F^{-ks} for some
nonzero c and integer k. The Rankin-Selberg integrals {I(s, W, V) : V varies}
generate a fractional ideal of R = C[q_F^s, q_F^{-s}]. Since R is a PID, the
ideal is principal: I = L(s, Pi x pi) R. Any monomial c q_F^{-ks} lies in I
because L(s, Pi x pi)^{-1} is a polynomial in q_F^{-s} (the local L-factor is
a product of (1 - alpha_i q_F^{-s})^{-1}), so c q_F^{-ks} L^{-1} in R.

It therefore suffices to show: for fixed W = W_0, the integrals over V still
generate the full fractional ideal.

**Step 2. The u_Q twist produces a nonzero Kirillov function.** The function

    phi_Q(g) := W_0(diag(g,1) u_Q)

lies in the Kirillov model of Pi restricted to GL_n. We verify phi_Q != 0 by
evaluation at g = I_n:

    phi_Q(I_n) = W_0(u_Q) = psi^{-1}(Q) W_0(I_{n+1}) = psi^{-1}(Q)

using the Whittaker transformation rule (u_Q in N_{n+1} with superdiagonal
entry Q) and the standard normalization W_0(I) = 1. Since psi is nontrivial
and Q != 0, psi^{-1}(Q) is a nonzero complex number on the unit circle.

**Step 3. Fixed-W spanning (the key lemma).** Let phi be any nonzero function
in the Kirillov model of Pi|_{GL_n}. We claim the integrals

    { int_{N_n\GL_n} phi(g) V(g) |det g|^{s-1/2} dg : V in W(pi, psi) }

generate the full fractional ideal L(s, Pi x pi) R.

*Proof.* Define Phi(phi) = the fractional ideal generated by these integrals.
By the PID property, Phi(phi) = L_phi R for some L_phi dividing L(s, Pi x pi).

*GL_n-equivariance:* For g_0 in GL_n, the substitution g -> g g_0 gives
I(s, R(g_0)phi, V) = |det g_0|^{1/2-s} I(s, phi, R'(g_0)V). Since R'(g_0)
is an automorphism of W(pi, psi), Phi(R(g_0)phi) = Phi(phi) (up to R-units).
So L_{R(g_0)phi} = L_phi for all g_0.

*Irreducibility:* The Kirillov model K(Pi)|_{GL_n} is irreducible as a
GL_n-representation (Bernstein-Zelevinsky 1976, Theorem 5.21). For any
nonzero phi, the translates {R(g_0)phi : g_0 in GL_n} span K(Pi)|_{GL_n}.

*Divisibility in both directions:* (1) Phi(phi) is contained in the full
ideal generated by all phi' and all V, so L(s, Pi x pi) | L_phi. (2) For any
nonzero phi' = sum c_i R(g_i)phi (by irreducibility), I(s, phi', V) =
sum c_i I(s, R(g_i)phi, V) in L_phi R for each V. Taking the union over all
phi': L(s, Pi x pi) R = union Phi(phi') subset L_phi R, so L_phi | L(s, Pi x pi).

Combining: L_phi = L(s, Pi x pi) up to units. QED

**Step 4. Conclusion.** Taking phi = phi_Q (nonzero by Step 2), the integrals
{I(s, W_0, V) : V} generate L(s, Pi x pi) R. By Step 1, some V makes the
integral a monomial — finite and nonzero for all s. The new vector W_0 works
universally for all pi. QED
