A consequence of this result is that given an absolutely simple algebraic K-group G of type D_n, n>4 even, K a number field, any K-form G' of G having the same set of isomorphism classes of maximal K-tori as G, is necessarily K-isomorphic to G.

The following two consequences motivated this work. First, there are hyperbolic equivariant corks (as defined in previous work of the authors) for a wide class of finite groups. Second, any finite group that acts on a homology $3$-sphere also acts on a hyperbolic homology $3$-sphere. The theorem has other applications, including establishing the existence of an infinite number of hyperbolic homology spheres with a free $Z_p$ action that does not extend to any contractible manifold. A non-equivariant version yields an infinite number of hyperbolic integer homology spheres that bound integer homology balls but do not bound contractible manifolds. In passing, it is shown that the invertible homology cobordism relation on $3$-manifolds is antisymmetric.",

      "summary": "Let $N$ be a smooth manifold that is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to a closed hyperbolic manifold $M$. In this paper, we study the extent to which $N$ admits as much symmetry as $M$. Our main results are examples of $N$ that exhibit two extremes of behavior. On the one hand, we find $N$ with maximal symmetry, i.e. Isom($M$) acts on $N$ by isometries with respect to some negatively curved metric on $N$. For these examples, Isom($M$) can be made arbitrarily large. On the other hand, we find $N$ with little symmetry, i.e. no subgroup of Isom($M$) of \"small\" index acts by diffeomorphisms of $N$. The construction of these examples incorporates a variety of techniques including smoothing theory and the Belolipetsky-Lubotzky method for constructing hyperbolic manifolds with a prescribed isometry group.",

      "summary": "In this paper, we adapt the well-known \\emph{local} uniqueness results of Borg-Marchenko type in the inverse problems for one dimensional Schr{\u00f6}dinger equation to prove \\emph{local} uniqueness results in the setting of inverse \\emph{metric} problems. More specifically, we consider a class of spherically symmetric manifolds having two asymptotically hyperbolic ends and study the scattering properties of massless Dirac waves evolving on such manifolds. Using the spherical symmetry of the model, the stationary scattering is encoded by a countable family of one-dimensional Dirac equations. This allows us to define the corresponding transmission coefficients $T(\u03bb,n)$ and reflection coefficients $L(\u03bb,n)$ and $R(\u03bb,n)$ of a Dirac wave having a fixed energy $\u03bb$ and angular momentum $n$. For instance, the reflection coefficients $L(\u03bb,n)$ correspond to the scattering experiment in which a wave is sent from the \\emph{left} end in the remote past and measured in the same left end in the future. The main result of this paper is an inverse uniqueness result local in nature. Namely, we prove that for a fixed $\u03bb\\not=0$, the knowledge of the reflection coefficients $L(\u03bb,n)$ (resp. $R(\u03bb,n)$) - up to a precise error term of the form $O(e^{-2nB})$ with $B\\textgreater{}0$ - determines the manifold in a neighbourhood of the left (resp. right) end, the size of this neighbourhood depending on the magnitude $B$ of the error term. The crucial ingredients in the proof of this result are the Complex Angular Momentum method as well as some useful uniqueness results for Laplace transforms.",

In contrast with the real rank $1$ case, this bound comes surprisingly close to the total number of such spaces as estimated in a previous work of Belolipetsky and Lubotzky [BL]. Our proof uses Sunada's method, results of [BL], and some deep results from number theory. We also discuss an open number-theoretical problem which would imply an even faster growth estimate.",
