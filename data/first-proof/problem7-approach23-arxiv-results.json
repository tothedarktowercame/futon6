In particular for $\\mathbb{F}$ an irreducible $SO(n,1)$-module, we show that the group cohomology with coefficients $H^{\\bullet}(\u0393, \\mathbb{F})$ is isomorphic to the cohomology of an appropriate projective BGG complex on $M$. This yields the geometric interpretation that $H^{\\bullet}(\u0393, \\mathbb{F})$ parameterises solutions to certain distinguished natural PDEs of Riemannian geometry, modulo the range of suitable differential coboundary operators. Viewed in another direction, the construction shows one way that non-trivial cohomology can arise in a BGG complex, and sheds considerable light on its geometric meaning. We also use the tools developed to give a new proof that $H^{1} (\u0393, S_{0}^{k} \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}) \\neq 0$ whenever $M$ contains a compact, orientable, totally geodesic hypersurface.

As an application, we show that there is a lower bound for the length of a closed geodesic having crossing number $k$ on a hyperbolic surface. This lower bound tends to infinity with $k$. Our second generalization is to totally geodesic hypersurfaces of hyperbolic manifolds. Namely, we construct a tubular neighborhood function and show that an embedded closed totally geodesic hypersurface in a hyperbolic manifold has a tubular neighborhood whose width only depends on the area of the hypersurface (and hence not on the geometry of the ambient manifold). The implications of this result for volumes of hyperbolic manifolds is discussed. We also derive a (hyperbolic) quantitative version of the Klein-Maskit combination theorem (in all dimensions) for free products of fuchsian groups. Using this last theorem, we construct examples to illustrate the qualitative sharpness of the tubular neighborhood function.",

As an application, we define a modification $\u0398^\u03c4_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ of the homology cobordism group which takes into account an involution on each homology sphere, and prove that this admits a $\\mathbb{Z}^\\infty$-subgroup of strongly non-extendable corks. The group $\u0398^\u03c4_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ can also be viewed as a refinement of the bordism group of diffeomorphisms. Using our invariants, we furthermore establish several new families of corks and prove that various known examples are strongly non-extendable. Our main computational tool is a monotonicity theorem which constrains the behavior of our invariants under equivariant negative-definite cobordisms, and an explicit method of constructing such cobordisms via equivariant surgery.",

The first is the stable neighborhood theorem which says that a (not necessarily simple) closed geodesic in a hyperbolic surface has a \\lq\\lq stable neighborhood\\rq\\rq whose width only depends on the length of the geodesic. As an application, we show that there is a lower bound for the length of a closed geodesic having crossing number $k$ on a hyperbolic surface. This lower bound tends to infinity with $k$. Our second generalization is to totally geodesic hypersurfaces of hyperbolic manifolds. Namely, we construct a tubular neighborhood function and show that an embedded closed totally geodesic hypersurface in a hyperbolic manifold has a tubular neighborhood whose width only depends on the area of the hypersurface (and hence not on the geometry of the ambient manifold). The implications of this result for volumes of hyperbolic manifolds is discussed. We also derive a (hyperbolic) quantitative version of the Klein-Maskit combination theorem (in all dimensions) for free products of fuchsian groups. Using this last theorem, we construct examples to illustrate the qualitative sharpness of the tubular neighborhood function.",

As an application, we define a modification $\u0398^\u03c4_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ of the homology cobordism group which takes into account an involution on each homology sphere, and prove that this admits a $\\mathbb{Z}^\\infty$-subgroup of strongly non-extendable corks. The group $\u0398^\u03c4_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ can also be viewed as a refinement of the bordism group of diffeomorphisms. Using our invariants, we furthermore establish several new families of corks and prove that various known examples are strongly non-extendable. Our main computational tool is a monotonicity theorem which constrains the behavior of our invariants under equivariant negative-definite cobordisms, and an explicit method of constructing such cobordisms via equivariant surgery.",

More specifically, we consider a class of spherically symmetric manifolds having two asymptotically hyperbolic ends and study the scattering properties of massless Dirac waves evolving on such manifolds. Using the spherical symmetry of the model, the stationary scattering is encoded by a countable family of one-dimensional Dirac equations. This allows us to define the corresponding transmission coefficients $T(\u03bb,n)$ and reflection coefficients $L(\u03bb,n)$ and $R(\u03bb,n)$ of a Dirac wave having a fixed energy $\u03bb$ and angular momentum $n$. For instance, the reflection coefficients $L(\u03bb,n)$ correspond to the scattering experiment in which a wave is sent from the \\emph{left} end in the remote past and measured in the same left end in the future. The main result of this paper is an inverse uniqueness result local in nature. Namely, we prove that for a fixed $\u03bb\\not=0$, the knowledge of the reflection coefficients $L(\u03bb,n)$ (resp. $R(\u03bb,n)$) - up to a precise error term of the form $O(e^{-2nB})$ with $B\\textgreater{}0$ - determines the manifold in a neighbourhood of the left (resp. right) end, the size of this neighbourhood depending on the magnitude $B$ of the error term.

      "summary": "In 1998, Mukherjee and Sankaran posed two problems concerning the algebraic structure of the equivariant bordism ring of smooth closed $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$-manifolds with only isolated fixed points. One is the property of being finitely generated as a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-algebra, and the other is the existence of indecomposable elements. This paper definitively resolves both problems for the fully effective case. Specifically, let $\\mathcal{Z}_*((\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k)$ denote the equivariant bordism ring of smooth closed manifolds equipped with fully effective smooth $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$-actions having only isolated fixed points. We prove that $\\mathcal{Z}_*((\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k)$ is not finitely generated as a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-algebra for all $k\\geqslant 3$. Moreover, the proof explicitly constructs an infinite family of indecomposable elements with unbounded degrees, thereby settling the second problem simultaneously.",
