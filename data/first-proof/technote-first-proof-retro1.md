# technote-first-proof-retro1

## Purpose
Companion editorial note for `data/first-proof/latex/sprint-review.tex`.
This is the first cut plan toward a ~25-page final paper.

## Roadmap to a 25-page paper

The current draft is rich but broad. A strong 25-page version can keep the
same thesis while tightening scope.

1. Core narrative (8 pages): Introduction, setup, scorecard, and one concise
comparison table.
2. Two deep case studies (10 pages): one success case (P6 layer switch) and
one failure pair (P1/P7 NO-obstruction failures), with explicit evidence
trails.
3. Cross-cutting synthesis (5 pages): success/failure patterns, calibration,
and protocol lessons.
4. Limits and forward protocol (2 pages): threats to validity, Batch 2
protocol changes, and claims we are not making.

## Practical cut rule

Move most per-problem narrative detail to an appendix (or leave in the
monograph), and keep only statements that change the paper's core claims
about methodology, correctness, and failure modes.
