They are trying to reconcile the apparent contradiction between circumference and distance traveled.", "arrow_constraint": "The constraint is understanding how the smaller circle can cover the same linear distance as the larger circle in one revolution, given the difference in their circumferences.

The student encounters several different utility functions (CES, exponential, quasilinear) and notices that they all seem to have certain properties (e.g., differentiability, concavity).
